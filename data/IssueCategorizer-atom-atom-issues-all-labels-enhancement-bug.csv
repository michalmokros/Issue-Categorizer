### Description

<!-- Description of the issue -->

I have always had `git config core.editor` set to `atom --wait`.
_NOTE:_ This also happens if I set the config to `atom --wait --safe`.

This issue appeared after I upgraded from version **1.36.0** to **1.40.1**

An old closed issue that might be related to this one: #16740

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the project folder in Atom.
2. Edit files and run `git commit`.
3. Because the project folder is already opened in Atom, the `COMMIT_EDITMSG` file is opened in a new tab in the existing window.
4. Write message and save.

_NOTE:_ Of course this also happens for `git rebase -i` and any other git operations that require input from the editor.

**Expected behavior:**

<!-- What you expect to happen -->

After closing the file tab the commit should finalize.

**Actual behavior:**

<!-- What actually happens -->

You need to close the window for the commit to finalize.

**Reproduces how often:**

<!-- What percentage of the time does it reproduce? -->

100% of the time.

### Versions

<!-- You can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running. -->

### Description

If one of the core setting that are configured to prompt for a restart are changed from their default value then Atom will prompt for a restart every time it starts up.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Change a core setting from [the following list](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/b79d9088e21970f0dd1d05ed0e2a27765d4b6dd4/src/main-process/atom-application.js#L283-L285) to a non-default value:
    * `core.titleBar`
    * `core.colorProfile`
    * `core.fileSystemWatcher`
2. Restart Atom

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
No prompt to restart Atom on launch.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
Prompts to restart Atom on _every_ launch, regardless of how many times you restart it.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]
100% of the time.

### Description

If I mount C: at /c, running `atom` in WSL won't load Atom:

```
$ findmnt --source C:
TARGET SOURCE FSTYPE OPTIONS
/c     C:     drvfs  rw,noatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=22,fmask=11,metadata,case=off
$ atom
The system cannot find the path specified.
```

`atom.sh` sets $root; It doesn't use it when setting $ATOMCMD, though:

https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c5ebfbddd096a24bb99b832432a5dfcd67da4714/resources/win/atom.sh#L8-L15

To me this seems like https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17794, but it's happening with Ubuntu 18.04 on WSL with Windows 10 (1809) and Atom 1.36.1.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. On Windows 10 (1809): Enable WSL, install Atom, install Ubuntu.
2. In Ubuntu on WSL, configure `/etc/wsl.conf` to mount root at /:
    ```
    [automount]
    root = /
    ```
3. Exit Ubuntu, run Ubuntu again, and run `atom`:
    ```
    atom
    ```

**Expected behavior:** Atom should open.
**Actual behavior:**

```
$ atom
The system cannot find the path specified.
```

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

### Versions

You can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.

atom 1.36.1
python 3.7.1
git 2.21.0.windows.1
visual studio
```

### Additional Information

This issue is just about _opening_ Atom using the built-in methods. With a fresh install of the Ubuntu app (no custom aliases or functions) and current default Windows / WSL (appends Windows %Path% to Linux $PATH), running `atom` in Linux will run `%LOCALAPPDATA%\atom\bin\atom` in your Windows user's home directory. That script calls your current Atom version's `atom.sh`:

```
$ cat $(which atom)
#!/bin/sh
""$(dirname ""$0"")/../app-1.36.1/resources/cli/atom.sh"" ""$@""
```

Other issues related to running Atom from Linux/WSL, like path availability or translation, are outside the scope of this issue.","bug"
"5","Opens new (duplicate) windows for already-open projects","### Description

If you launch Atom from the command line multiple times in the same directory, it should re-use the same Atom window each time.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a directory with Atom (e.g., `atom /path/to/directory`)
2. Open the same directory with Atom a second time (e.g., `atom /path/to/directory`)

**Expected behavior:** One Atom window should be open showing files for the directory

**Actual behavior:** Two Atom windows are open showing files for the directory

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

### Versions

macOS 10.14.3

```
$ atom-nightly --version
Atom    : 1.37.0-nightly15
Electron: 2.0.18

### Additional Information

This also causes Atom to open a new window when you're using Atom as your Git commit editor. As a result, we lose the [performance benefits introduced in Atom 1.25](https://blog.atom.io/2018/03/15/atom-1-25.html#performance-and-responsiveness) for people wanting to use Atom as their Git commit editor.

**Actual behavior:**

The scrollbar stays visible.

**Reproduces how often:**

100%. But not in all locations. For example the editor and tree-view is fine.

### Description

It would be great if the ordering would be influenced by abbreviations. 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>
2. enter `js`

**Expected behavior:**
E.g. if I enter `js` I would expect Java Script to be the first result since it's an exact abbreviation. I would expect this for other abbreviations too.

**Actual behavior:**
I get the following grammars:
1. `JSON`
2. `JSDoc`
3. `JSON (Twig)`
4. `Java Properties`
5. `Javascript (Twig)`
6. `JUnit Test Report`
7. `JavaScript`

I could understand if it were on the 4th place since the 1st to 3rd places match on the beginning.
However I would prefer if abbreviations would be rated just a little less then a full match.

I am new to Atom ( i am shifting from `sublime-text` to `Atom`)
Goto line package in Atom is waiting for user to press enter, but i think it should goto line as user types a number (as there its in sublime text). If an user wants to goto line `812` as user enters `8` editor should goto line `8` and next when `1` is pressed it should goto line # `81` etc.

"11","Customize presence/absence/ignored of final EOL","*@mcandre commented on Feb 25, 2018, 3:01 AM UTC:*

Proper LF text files feature a final EOL terminator at the end, and even CRLF files benefit from a final EOL terminator. For example, C/C++ `*.h` headers and `*.js` client code may break when a final EOL is absent, due to the way that these files are concatenated. Some formats such as (GNU) Makefile's require a final EOL terminator.

To help the user safeguard against these kinds of surprises, it would be helpful if line-ending-selector offered an additional setting to manage this. Aside from the choice of line sequence (LF, CRLF, CR, etc.), the user should be able to select, a default and per-file setting of:

*   EOL Present
*   EOL Absent
*   EOL Ignored

This way, sensitive text files are sure to feature the right end of file terminator.

"12","Intelligent defaults based on mimetype","*@mcandre commented on Feb 25, 2018, 3:08 AM UTC:*

The current settings menu for line-ending-selector is fairly flexible, allowing users to default to either UNIX-style LF line endings, or Windows-style CRLF line endings for new text files. However, I think we can do better:

*   Regardless of default line-ending value, start new UNIX-specific files in LF mode (`*.sh`, `*.bash`, `.profile`, etc.)
*   Regardless of default line-ending value, start new Windows-specific files in CRLF mode (`*.bat`, `*.cmd`, `*.ps1`, `*.vbs`, `*.cs`, `*.fs`, etc.)

This way, users can be sure to use an appropriate line ending format for critical file types, while using their preferential default of LF/CRLF for non-specific files (`*.txt`, `*.md`, `*.py`, etc.)

I managed to solve the issue by using ""Normalize File EOL's On Save"" feature of the ""line-ending-converter"" package, but that package is not maintained because we have line ending selector now :)

We should add this feature on the line-ending-selector package!

"14","Allow converting line endings for multiple files in project","*@RichyHBM commented on Oct 31, 2016, 9:24 PM UTC:*

It would be great to have the ability to convert files from the project side-view, maybe by right clicking on the file and selecting ""convert line endings""?
If you were to do so on a file the default behaviour could happen, opening the file in the editor view and changing the endings without saving. But doing so on a folder should prompt the line ending to convert all files bellow that folder to; this could then auto save or, batch open all the files in editor and convert the endings without saving (the user could then click on close alll and hit save for all of the files)

"16","Change Report Issue button to reflect current status of the deprecation","_From @eboracus on July 17, 2015 18:31_

It would be nice if the report issue button behaved similarly to the Uncaught Error notification's report issue button. So if the error/issue has already been reported the button changes visually to inform the user, and they know it's not necessary to go and report it.

The button could still link through to the logged issue's page as it does now, but just give the information to the user without them having to click and open up the link to find out.

Currently when the dev tools pops up it only shows the top of the stack for the errors that were logged.

This can make it hard to tell which package caused it and you have to do the whole open the dev tools first, reproduce the error, get the stack dance.

So start collecting the last 10 or so and make the log-able from dev tools using something like `printRecentErrors()`.

This method could even check the stack and tell you which package it came from by looking for `~/.atom/packages` in the stack.

I think its really cool, that the package checks if there is already an open issue on github. But the default button says **Report Error** and if you click it and the issue was in fact already reported, nothing happens. A good 2-3 seconds later the button changes to **View Issue**. I would appreciate it, if there was a visual indicator, that atom is searching online.

### Description

When an exception occurs, and the stacktrace includes a core JavaScript API, the exception-reporting package fails to report the exception to bugsnag. For example, the stacktrace below involves an exception in the fuzzy-finder package, and the stacktrace includes a call to `Array.forEach`:

### Description

This is a very narrow edge case in the implementation of atom/github#1512. The symptom I observed is described in @Arcanemagus' [comment](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1512#issuecomment-422573966):

> If lines are wrapped in the diff, on first click in the diff window after initial rendering the line wrapping is recalculated. Probably an issue with the initial width calculation?

> ![soft-wrap-changing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/45719250-99654d00-bb54-11e8-9a31-f1bc9eedf3b1.gif)

Essentially, what's happening is that a soft-wrapped TextEditor with custom gutters is being rendered on the first frame with an incorrect soft wrap margin, because a change in gutter width measurement isn't triggering a re-update.

### Steps to Reproduce

This one's tricky to reproduce because (a) we don't use custom gutters that heavily, (b) when we do, they're often decorated, which triggers a component update and conceals the bug, and (c) it only manifests with soft-wrapping enabled.

1. Disable core packages that create decorations on TextEditor creation (`apm disable spell-check && apm disable git-diff`).
2. Create a text file that will be soft-wrapped at your typical screen width.
3. Add the following to your init script:
   ```js
   atom.workspace.observeTextEditors(editor => {
      editor.addGutter({name: 'repro', priority: 10})
   });
   ```
4. Add the following to your stylesheet:
    ```less
    .gutter[gutter-name=""repro""] {
      width: 100px;
      background-color: grey;
    }
    ```
5. Enable soft wrapping (_not_ at preferred line length) in TextEditors in the Settings View or in your dev console.
    ```js
    atom.config.set('editor.softWrap', true)
    atom.config.set('editor.softWrapAtPreferredLineLength', false)
    ```
4. (Re-)open Atom in safe mode.
5. Open the file you prepared in step 2.
6. Interact with the opened editor pane in any way. A mouse click anywhere will trigger this.

**Expected behavior:**

The soft-wrap column should be calculated on the first render accounting for the width of the custom gutter. Editor interactions such as clicking to position a cursor or scrolling vertical content should not alter the soft-wrap column.

**Actual behavior:**

The soft-wrap column is calculated initially _without_ accounting for the custom gutter width, but then accounted for on the next re-render for any cause, resulting in some jank:

"31","Use wrap-guide's column length if it differs from editor's preferred line length","_From @jasonrudolph on December 26, 2013 21:49_

When the [wrap-guide settings](https://github.com/atom/wrap-guide/blob/4ffdee199951398f5953fe575dfa3c777e0cdbc0/docs/index.md#configuration) differ from the `editor.preferredLineLength` setting, it would be awesome if the autoflow package used the wrap-guide settings to determine the line length.
#### Example Use Case

For most files, I prefer a line length of 80 characters. So, I have `editor.preferredLineLength` set to `80`.

But for Git commit messages, [72 characters is a better choice](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html). To help me stick to that guideline, I have a [custom `wrap-guide` setting](https://github.com/atom/wrap-guide/blob/4ffdee199951398f5953fe575dfa3c777e0cdbc0/docs/index.md#configuration) for commit messages:

``` cson
'wrap-guide':
  'columns': [
    {
      'pattern': 'COMMIT_EDITMSG'
      'column': 72
    }
```

I'd love to be able to reflow a commit message to 72 characters. Currently, when you reflow a paragraph, it uses `editor.preferredLineLength` to determine the line length.

The gif below demonstrates the current behavior. Note the wrap-guide at 72 characters, and the reflow wrap at 80 characters:

![autoflow-demo](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2988/1812282/7fce0bba-6e75-11e3-86cc-0daca6ed4b33.gif)

In my case, the commit message gets reflowed at 80 characters instead of 72. It would be awesome if it wrapped at 72 characters.

---

Note: I'm not sure whether we would want the autoflow package to have a dependency on the wrap-guide package. (Seems kinda weird.) Maybe these two packages should be combined?

"32","Reflow multiple paragraphs","_From @ahti on March 2, 2014 15:45_

It's not currently possible to reflow multiple paragraphs at once.
- When multiple cursors are placed, only the paragraph containing the first cursor is reflowed.
- When text is selected across multiple paragraphs, only the paragraph containing the beginning of the selection is reflowed.

I think in these cases the expected behaviour would be to reflow every paragraph that contains a cursor or is part of the selection.

Additionally, I think a separate command for reflowing the whole buffer would be useful.

"33","""Auto-reflow"" on editing","_From @ahti on March 2, 2014 15:48_

I think it might be useful to have an option to reflow paragraphs after every edit (typing, insertion, deletion, ...), so the user doesn't need to remember to reflow his buffer after writing.

Because this might not make sense for every kind of document, I think it would be reasonable to allow the user to select on which document kinds (identified by their grammar) this feature should be enabled.

Hi,
I have not a gif but this issue is easily reproducible. 

When I comment a long line with Latex (comment starts with `%`) and then run reflow selection, the comment is truncated (reflown) but only the first part is commented. The following new lines are not commented.

I tested only Latex but maybe this issue affects other languages as well.

Thanks

_From @danbim on July 1, 2015 10:1_

If I have a block of text indented and I use the ""reflow selection"" command (cmd+alt+q on Mac) the resulting text block will only keep the intended indentation in the first line but lose it in the following lines. While for some file types this might be the correct behaviour, IMO for many others it's not. Therefore ""reflow selection"" is unusable for my source code.

![screen shot 2015-07-01 at 11 57 20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300638/8452143/ced99d34-1fe8-11e5-910e-b9e79629aa2a.png)

If the current behaviour is still to be supported I suggest to make this a customizable behaviour, e.g., depending on file type.

If there is a [non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space) at a breaking point, autoreflow will break it and delete it.

Exemple:
Input:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmo tempor « incididunt ut labore »
                                                                                ^ 81st char and non-breaking space
```

After reflow:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmo tempor «
incididunt ut labore »
```

The non-breaking space has been broken!

Expected:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmo tempor
« incididunt ut labore »
```

The non-breaking space should not be broken

### Description

[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) is an attempt at standardizing certain configurations across text/code editors, to help keep things consistent, no matter who is editing the file or with what program. You can configure [settings](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties) for a whole project, a directory, or specific files matched using globbing patterns, with rules set in standard INI format.

In particular, I think it would be helpful if Autoflow followed the `max_line_length` directive, which defines what *should* be the maximum number of characters per line. EditorConfig currently only uses the value here to set the placement of a visual text wrapping guide --- i.e., a *hint*, rather than forcing hard-wrap. However, I think ""maximum line length"" is semantically related enough that it would make sense for Autoflow to use this directive when determining how to rewrap text in the current context.

If I open the file from `repo/docs/topics`, git-diff line marking in the gutter does work.

I'm not sure when it started breaking, but I think it was after I installed 1.14.0. I don't think this is the same issue as #91, as this directory structure has been working fine with git-diff until this week.

I have a file with CRLFs.
I use the git setting that automatically takes care of it, and commits files with LF instead of CRLF.
When I type git diff on that file, I don't see any changes.
Whereas in the Atom Minimap, all the lines are orange, except for the last one.
This makes it impossible to properly use this package since all lines have changes.

Maybe this package should not consider the CRLF instead of LF as a change.

Also feel free to comment below, but keep in mind that this issue is not meant to brainstorm solutions and only focuses on the problems first. If we want to improve something, an RFC should be proposed.

---

## Can't quickly switch projects

When wanting to switch to another project, Atom opens a new window which takes a while. And you also have to close the current window. Also, the new window size and placement could be different and might need adjustment. 

**Workaround**:

- You could re-use the same window by removing and adding root folders in the tree-view, but that feels tedious.
- Use packages like [project-plus](https://atom.io/packages/project-plus), [project-jump](https://atom.io/packages/project-jump), [project-switcher2](https://atom.io/packages/project-switcher2)

## No way to limit the scope to a single root project

When having multiple root projects, find and replace or fuzzy finder always search in all projects. But sometimes you might want some projects not to be ""active"" and just use as reference. Similar issue: [https://github.com/atom/github/issues/1676](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/1676)

**Workaround**: Temporarily remove and then after the search, add the removed projects back again.

## Autocomplete is not auto enough

When Autocomplete shows several options, the order is chronological. If the option you want is not near the top, you have to spell it out or use the arrow key many times.

**Workaround**: None.

## Slow settings for Packages/Themes and Updates

It usually takes several seconds until the list of packages/themes is shown. Or when showing in the Status Bar that there are new updates available, it still takes a long time until the updates show up in the settings.

**Workaround**: Install [package-settings](https://atom.io/packages/package-settings) to open a package's settings directly.

## Package discovery is hard to find in the settings

People instinctively go to `Settings > Packages` and then start to type to search for a package, not realizing that they have to go to `Settings > Install`. This came up in the past https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/825, but hasn't gotten enough priority.

**Workaround**: Use `apm install package-name`.

## It's hard to know the health of a package

There are many packages that are abandoned and not maintained anymore. They are either broken or have bugs that make it less usable. But it's hard to know before installing a package and trying it out.

**Workaround**: Go to the repo to check a package's ""health"".

## Command palette could get over-polluted.

Because there are quite a few commands, more when installing a lot of packages, it becomes hard to use commands without spelling them out.

**Workaround**: Remove packages so they don't pollute the list, use a keymap or install the [tool-bar](https://atom.io/packages/tool-bar) package.

## Some functionality is hard to discover

For example the GitHub package has a dock item with current and open PRs, but it's hard to discover that this exists. See this [issue](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/1573)

**Workaround:**

- Look through `Menu > Packages`
- Look through command palette
- Package authors could add a button to the Status Bar, although the Status Bar shouldn't be (mis-)used as a navigation

## Package authors need to build their own UI

Atom provides some UI components like select-list, tooltip, mini-editor and there are also some CSS-only components in the [Styleguide](https://github.com/atom/styleguide/) like button, checkbox, inputs etc. But otherwise package authors need to build everything themselves. It's great to have the freedom, but it's also a lot of extra work and consistency lacks between all the packages.

**Workaround**: Package authors could use a 3rd party UI library.

On Windows and macOS you have a button to update Atom to the latest version. It would be nice if Linux also had that. If the update functionality will not be implemented (anytime soon), it would be nice if there's a button that tells you if an update is available - just so you know that your version is outdated. And perhaps also instructions on how to update.

Currently, you have to check at https://github.com/atom/atom/releases to see if there is a newer version. Understandably, that is far from ideal.

### Additional Information

The essence of the problem is at [this line](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/5b485dcb4b48386d9480ab45dc389cbcaad3d454/src/update-process-env.js#L110) in ```update-process-env.js```. It is using newlines to split the result of executing
```
command env
```
within the user's shell at [this line](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/5b485dcb4b48386d9480ab45dc389cbcaad3d454/src/update-process-env.js#L77)

Instead, I recommend using \0 to split the result of executing
```
command awk 'BEGIN{for(v in ENVIRON) printf(""%s=%s\0"", v, ENVIRON[v])}'
```
within the user's shell. This would address newlines in the variable values and the extremely rare case of newlines in the variable names.

### Description

I still haven't managed to pin down exactly when this happens, but I'd say it happens at least a few times per day when I'm working on soft-wrapped files.

<img width=""44"" alt=""duplicate-soft-wrap-indicators"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2766036/41429626-a26383a0-6fdb-11e8-9af0-7549ece3554f.png"">
Scrolling such that the soft wrap indicators are off the screen and then scrolling back fixes the issue.

### Steps to Reproduce

As of yet, unknown.  Prerequisites include having soft wrap turned on and from what I can tell, a file that is not only soft wrapped but also requires vertical scrolling.

### Versions

You can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.

### Description

Tooltips like for example file path when hovering over tab name at the top or tooltip ""Click to fetch"" when over ""Fetch"" at the bottom should GO AWAY the moment keyboard event happens (typing anything or simple arrow keys clicks, etc) even if mouse cursor is still over the ""tooltip triggering area"".

Otherwise, tooltip becomes annoyance instead of helping hand, obstructing my workspace.

### Steps to Reproduce

---
*Edit by @rsese to add alternate repro steps*

Using atom/atom as an example:

1. `atom --safe .`
2. Open `SUPPORT.md`
3. Hover over the tab for the file so the path tooltip appears
4. Start typing

---

1. Type in workspace document.
2. Hover mouse over ""tooltip triggering area"", wait for tooltip to appear.
3. Continue typing while not moving away the mouse.

**Expected behavior:** Tooltip(s) should be gone either on mouse hover away OR when any input event happens like keyboard click, mouse click (?), etc.

**Actual behavior:** Tooltip keeps in the place until I move mouse away only.

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

### Description

When a package is installed from a git repository Atom doesn't check the [`engines`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines) field in `package.json`. Atom should at least warn the user that their version of atom is not supported by that package, or wouldn't allow the package to be enabled/updated/installed like with regular community packages.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install a git package that doesn't support your version of atom. I have set up a package called [`test-engines-package`](https://atom.io/packages/test-engines-package) for this situation at https://github.com/UziTech/test-engines-package

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

Somewhere Atom should warn that this package does not support this version of Atom

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

Nothing. The package installs just fine.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable ""Filesystem Event Diagnostics"" in the `github` package
2. Open a project folder that contains a git repository
3. Open the console and see the errors when the `fs watcher` starts up

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

No errors.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

Errors.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]

100% of the time.

Note that if the `github` package's `fs watcher` doesn't initialize, this doesn't show normally.

### Versions

This started happening on builds after https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/553dec3e7a84ccb1965f557a1aad36822025905e.

Seen on both Windows (10 x64 Enterprise) and macOS builds.

### Additional Information

The changes to `text-buffer` brought in by that commit can be found here: https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/compare/v13.12.4...v13.13.0. The suspicious commit being merging https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/280 as it introduced `cpy-cli` as a direct `dependency` instead of a `devDependency` as it should have been. That package has `string_decoder` as a dependency, and although `string_decoder` was already in the tree that PR moved it from a `devDependency` to a regular `dependency`.

I _believe_ that https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/296 will fix it, but have been unable to test without a version of `text-buffer` on NPM that includes it.

### Description

Atom is unable to save any file if the file encoding is erroneously set to Nordic.
I use a Windows 10 box with atom version 1.25.0 x64. As part of configuring settings either I or one of the plugins set the Nordic from Western(Windows 1252). This was causing Atom to not be able to save *any* file. Also the error message string , while trying to save, was empty. Hence we didn't had an idea about what was Atom barfing about.

NOTE: This problem may be more widespread ie there may be bugs about switching ""File Encodings"" to other values as well even though the problem I encountered was about Nordic locale.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Settings
2. Change file encoding to ""Nordic""
3. Create a new file, write some gibberish and try to save it

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
File should get saved. The * (showing unmodified file in cmd line) should disappear

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
File doesn't get saved. The * (showing unmodified file in cmd line) is present.

*Edit by @rsese mentioning the console error*


On Windows, the error in console is:

```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Invalid encoding name: ISO-8859-10

### Description
Dragging a file from the finder so the mouse path crosses the dock toggle of a closed left dock (tree-view pane) triggers the dock toggle, but does not redraw the rest of the window to accommodate the pop-out.

### Steps to Reproduce
(Note: I have vertical tabs and tree-view enabled.)
1. With Atom open and the tree-view pane closed, open file manager/finder to the left of the window.
2. Drag a file from the file manager/finder to the Atom window so it crosses the toggle control on the closed dock.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
File appears in new tab with no other events triggered.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
The tree-view pane opens, but the rest of the window does not redraw to accommodate it. Toggling the dock after this moves the rest of the window back and forth as if the dock were toggling but not the dock, which remain open over overlaps the other content in the window.

Only resolved by restarting Atom.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]
100%
Only occurs when dragging and dropping. Just dragging over the window with the left button pressed and nothing selected has no effect.

### Versions
Various. Tested both on Mac (beta) and multiple Windows boxes (current non-beta and older standalone).

### Additional Information
Disabled vertical tabs and toolbar, both to no effect.
Reproducible on bottom dock as well. Nothing docked to right.
Maybe the toggle is looking for a mouse event without checking whether the event occurred over the toggle or entered the toggle after occurring elsewhere? The dev console doesn't show any listeners for the toggle or its immediate parent divs.

### Description

Here is the excerpt of test-spec for my cursor-history pkg.
Maybe because of bug of v1.25.0-beta3, `atom.config.get` return actual config defined in `config.cson` rather than it's default value in the very first executed section.
Which make `f`-ocused spec tested in wrong condition. Also very first test is executed in environment dependent config value.

From quick code check(not tested throughly), maybe these lines does set env specific config.
https://github.com/atom/atom/blame/master/src/atom-environment.js#L213-L225
May be because of change in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16628#issuecomment-367172653?

```javascript
  fdescribe('initial state of history entries', () => {
    it('1', () => {

      // v1.24.0:        9999(default value)
      // v1.25.0-beta3:  5(my local config set in config.cson!!)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. write sample test spec I explained above using whatever config you want(e.g. `atom.config.get('editor.atomicSoftTabs')`).
2. See how `atom.config.get` return value change in 1st and 2nd section of test spec.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

Test spec should be executed in default configuration like in v1.24.0.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

Test spec is executed in env-dependent config for very first call of `atom.config.get`.

"62","Improve soft-wrapping by breaking words like web browsers","### Description

Current soft-wrapping behavior is not aggressive enough and sometimes leads to bad results.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable «Soft Wrap» and «Soft Wrap at Preferred Line Length» in «Editor» tab of Settings
2. Copy an URL in a text editor tab or a sequence of non-spaces characters that have more characters than the Preferred Line Length setting

**Expected behavior:**

* Break character sequences on spaces, dashes and slashes, like in a web browser
* Break character sequences at most at the «Preferred Line Length» setting
* Show a grayed out character, like those for EOL or spaces, when Atom break a word that had no spaces in it. Suggestion for default character: broken bar `¦`, which is present in the same Unicode block than  `¤¬»`.

For example, if Preferred Line Length is set to 20, then it should behave like this (`|` character represent the wrap-guide):

```
https://github.com¦ |
/atom/atom/issues¦  |
/new                |
                    |
Averylongword-¦     |
thatshouldbreak     |
                    |
Averylongword-    ¦ |  # four spaces after the dash and we see where it stops
thatshouldbreak     |  # ¦ allows to differentiate with the previous example
                    |
Averylongwordwithnos|¦  # no space, dash or slash in the word
eparator            |
```

**Actual behavior:**

* Character sequences break only on spaces
* If the character sequence doesn’t contain space and fill the whole line, the word is cut at the window edge instead of the expected Preferred Line Length (see screenshot).

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

It looks like `color` type values aren't being synced properly to the main process after https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16628 was merged.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open two windows of Atom v1.25.0-beta0+
2. Have a package that has a `type: color` setting (eg. `atom-material-ui`)
3. Open Developer Tools on the main window
4. Open theme settings in the second window, and open the `atom-material-ui` config
5. Change one of the colors in the second window
6. Watch the first window fail to validate the color

**Expected behavior:**

The `color` setting properly transfers to the main window.

**Actual behavior:**

The following `Error` is thrown:
```
Error: Validation failed at atom-material-ui.colors.abaseColor, {""_alpha"":1,""_blue"":131,""_green"":20,""_red"":117} cannot be coerced into a color

    at emitThree (events.js:121)
    at EventEmitter.emit (events.js:197)
```

From what I can tell so far the bug is that the [`Color`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/f866978d119e48734c82cad4a685ed7c9261d04f/src/color.js) Object from the second window is being `emit`ed to the main window... but the problem is that it only has `_name` properties defined _directly_ on it, the main `name` properties are all `get`ters. This means that when it gets to the main window all that is left is an Object like `{""_alpha"":1,""_blue"":192,""_green"":107,""_red"":92}` instead of a real `Color` object. Since that Object isn't a `Color` object, it fails the schema enforcer for a `color` setting.

### Versions

This started happening in this version, based on https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/e74ea4797521c845f040638d01d41a1677c9ddb8:

Electron: 1.7.11
Chrome  : 58.0.3029.110
Node    : 7.9.0
```

A build based on https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/a48624dc0255458a4bd73ffca02a545080a9d34a (right before #16628 was merged) **doesn't** show this issue:

### Description

If certain custom themes are selected before entering safe mode, they are loaded and activated during safe mode instead of being forced to One Dark temporarily.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set a custom theme (`atom-material-ui@2.1.3`)
2. Close Atom
3. Launch Atom in safe mode using `atom --safe`
4. Note that the custom theme is still active and shows as an option in the list.
5. Select a built in theme (`one-dark-ui`)
6. Close Safe Mode and launch Atom in Safe Mode again
7. Note that only the built in themes show as options in the theme selection list.
8. Close Atom, launch in normal mode
9. Select a _different_ UI theme (`city-lights-ui@1.3.3`)
10. Restart Atom in safe mode
11. Note that One Dark is selected as the theme as it should be.

**Expected behavior:**

Custom themes are not loaded or available in Safe Mode.

**Actual behavior:**

Certain custom themes can continue showing in Safe Mode if they was selected before entering Safe Mode:

### Description

If you attempt to drag an item to a closed Dock panel, the panel goes into a fit of opening/closing and doesn't allow you to place the item in it.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Atom v1.25.0-beta0 in safe mode
2. Have a closed Dock item
2. Attempt to drag something into the closed Dock item

**Expected behavior:**

The Dock panel opens and allows dropping the item in it.

Here is how Atom v1.24.0 behaves:

_Note: You can see that the Dock panel has a little ""hiccup"" that looks similar to what is now happening, but resolves itself._

**Actual behavior:**

The Dock panel rapidly opens and closes, preventing the item from being dropped there until you can open it (with another item).

### Description

Atom is no longer deduplicating project paths when a request to open a path is made, this means that you open multiple windows to the same location instead of focusing the current window.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a folder in Atom
2. Open the same folder again

**Expected behavior:**

Atom simply focuses the instance that is already open.

**Actual behavior:**

Atom v1.25.0-beta0 opens a new window on the same folder, so there are now two windows open to the same folder.

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

When attempting to use `atom --wait` as the `git config core.editor` setting as introduced in Atom v1.25.0-beta0 by https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16497, it seems the functionality attempted in that PR doesn't work under Windows, since the Atom window that the editor was spawn in still needs to fully close for `git` to consider the message as ready.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set Atom as your `git` editor
    * Git (all platforms): `git config --global core.editor 'atom --wait'`
    * PowerShell: `$Env:GIT_EDITOR='atom --wait'`
    * CMD: `set GIT_EDITOR='atom --wait'`
2. Make a commit with `git`
3. Close the tab for the file that was opened

**Expected behavior:**

As soon as the tab is closed `git` considers the message done and does the commit.

**Actual behavior:**

`git` waits for the _specific_ window that the message was opened in to close before considering the commit ready.

### Description

I downloaded the Debian package from atom.io and installed the package inside a Docker container with Ubuntu 16.04.
Prior to `dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb`, I installed the dependencies via `apt-get`.
When I tried running Atom, it failed with an error message about missing libX11-xcb.so.1.

The full list of missing packages is:

- libx11-xcb1
- libxss1
- libasound2
- libxkbfile1

Since I started with a minimal Ubuntu, there might be more missing dependencies.

"83","toggleLineCommentsForBufferRows not respected","Reported in halp: support/9de8cd36f0dc11e794c1b414dfdb471a

> Atom used to take commentStartString verbatim; however, in recent versions, it no longer respects user wishes/configuration -- instead erroneously imposing arbitrary and undesired formatting. Specifically, toggleLineCommentsForBufferRows (in text-editor.js) is hardwired to trim commentStartString, then subsequently append a space, as opposed to simply respecting the value set in commentStartString. If a user has gone to the trouble of removing trailing space from commentStartString of any/all grammars, toggleLineCommentsForBufferRows should not be reintroducing them.

### Description

The menu for my package ([atom-xterm](https://atom.io/packages/atom-xterm)) shows an incorrect key binding. See the following.

### Description

Tags: API, menu, atom.menu.add(), dispose()

If a menu object is disposed, this object is not disposed properly when one of the object's items is a 'separator`.

Building the object would be with the instruction
`favoritesMenu = atom.menu.add( .. )`

Disposing of the object would be..
`favoritesMenu.dispose()`

<br>

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the development console in Atom.
2. Execute code in the console to create a complex menu entry.
`favoritesMenu = atom.menu.add( .. )`
3. Execute code in the console to dispose of the menu entry.
`favoritesMenu.dispose()`

- - - -

#### Scenario1 - Does work
Execute code in the development console...
* Creates menu items as expected.<br>
Notice the `- - - -` item.
```js
favoritesMenu = atom.menu.add ([{
  label: 'Extra',
  submenu : [{
    label: 'Test',
    submenu: [
      {label: 'item1'},
      {label: '- - - - '},
      {label: 'item2'}
    ]
  }]
}])
```

* Dispose all menu items as expected.
```js
favoritesMenu.dispose()
```

- - - -

#### Scenario2 - Does not work
Execute code in the development console...
* Creates menu items as expected.<br>
Notice the `separator` item.
```js
favoritesMenu = atom.menu.add ([{
  label: 'Extra',
  submenu : [{
    label: 'Test',
    submenu: [
      {label: 'item1'},
      {type: 'separator'},
      {label: 'item2'}
    ]
  }]
}])
```

* Attempt to dispose all menu items with unexpected result.
```js
favoritesMenu.dispose()
```
- - - -

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
All items are removed from the menu if `dispose()` is executed.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
Scenario1 occurs as expected. Scenario2 does not work as expected.
Scenario2: Items `item1` and `item2` is removed as expected. however `Extra -> Test -> separator` remains. Restarting Atom brings back normality.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]
100%

### Versions

* Atom V1.23.2 
* Atom V1.24-beta 2
* Windows 10 Professional

### Additional Information

Originally reported by @gliviu on https://discuss.atom.io/t/menu-refresh-fails-for-separators/51255. @gliviu constructed similar coding in `init.js` which led him to discover the behaviour.

[AtomEnvironment](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.23.2/AtomEnvironment) is decaffinated in the Atom v1.24.0-beta2 release; however, the instance properties for this class are no longer documented. This means that they don't appear in either the `atom-api.json` file or (presumably) the online documentation itself.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Grab the `atom-api.json` file from the [1.24.0-beta2 Release Page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.24.0-beta2).
2. Attempt to search out any of the properties for the AtomEnvironment class, such as `textEditors`.
3. Note the absence of any of these properties.

**Expected behavior:** The properties for AtomEnvironment should be available within an array under the `instanceProperties` key.

### Description

I'm currently writing a package where I modify the DOM-elements within every atom-pane element through JS, but a problem arises because new unsaved files have no unique identifier. Other files have a name or path attribute which also exist on the TextEditor object, but the new unsaved file panes and the TextEditor object have no common data. I think it would be ideal for every atom-pane to have an ID attribute derived from the TextEditor object.

**Update:** slight misunderstanding of the inner workings of the DOM, see [new reply](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16434#issuecomment-355865346) for the correct description of the issue.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Authorize atom.io to access your GitHub account (https://atom.io/login)
2. Copy your atom.io API token (https://atom.io/account)
3. Use this token to log in to apm:

In this example, jasonrudolph/atom-test-package *does* exist, *is* an atom package, and I *do* you have access to it.

**Expected behavior:**

`apm` responds with an error explaining that the user needs to reauthorize atom.io to access their GitHub account. Ideally, the error message would include a link to allow the user to go back through the OAuth flow.

### Description

Default `ctrl-tab` key does `pane:show-next-recently-used-item`. I would like 
`ctrl-pagedown` to do the same. but even after I mapped `ctrl-pagedown` to act the same-
Using `ctrl-tab` works smoothly but using `ctrl-pagedown` is glitchly.
They should be acting the same but for some unknown reason they don't...

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Map `ctrl-pagedown` key as `ctrl-tab`:
open `keymap.cjson`, type:

```
'body':
  'ctrl-pagedown': 'pane:show-next-recently-used-item',
  'ctrl-pagedown ^ctrl': 'pane:move-active-item-to-top-of-stack'
```
Save `keymap.cjson` file.
2.  Have at least 2 open tabs: call it `tab1`, `tab2`, edit both, finish at `tab1`.
3.1 scenario:
go to `tab1`
Hold `ctrl`, type `pagedown` **once**, wait 10 secs (3 secs should do it), release `ctrl`
OR
3.2 scenario:
Hold `ctrl`, type `pagedown` several times **fast** , to move between the open files (in popup, see image below), 

**Expected behavior:** 
Switching **smoothly** between the open files in the popup screen.
Just use the default keys to see _Expected behavior_:
3.1 scenario:
After releasing of `ctrl`, it should switch from `tab1` to `tab2`

3.2 scenario:
Hold `ctrl`, type `tab` several times **fast** , and see how it works **smoothly**, like it should.
The files in popup (open by the first `ctrl-tab`) are being switched quickly.


**Actual behavior:** 
3.1 scenario:
After releasing of `ctrl` (after waiting 10 secs), not switching from `tab1` to `tab2`, staying in same tab: `tab1`
3.2 scenario:
Switching **glitchly** between the open files in the popup screen.
(If you type `pagedown` fast enough) You need to click `pagedown` 2 times (instead of once) for it to switch a single file in popup.


**Reproduces how often:**
100%, All the time.
### Versions

    Electron: 1.6.15
    Chrome  : 56.0.2924.87
    Node    : 7.4.0
```

### Additional Information
Glitch **only** occur **when you click fast enough (or to be more accurate: not slow enough)**
If you hold`ctrl` then click -`pagedown` wait 3 secs, click `pagedown`, wait 3 secs- It will kinda work.
Just try it- easy to see once you try it. It works **differently** for some reason, not like the default `ctrl-tab`.

*Edit by @rsese - steps to repro from [below](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16250#issuecomment-358185518)*

1. `sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=400` - setting it to a super low value to generate the error (was set to 65536 on my Ubuntu vm)
2. start Atom in atom/atom `atom --safe .`
3. Open devtools console <kbd>ctrl-shift-i</kbd> and see the same error [as @stratacast](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16250#issuecomment-357391904) (""NSFW was unable to start watching that directory"")

Now if you open a file in Atom and then edit that file in some other program (e.g. vim), any changes outside of Atom won't reload the file in Atom and you can save over the changes.

### Description

If I make some changes within a file, which is linked with Git, it marks the changed lines. If I then discard my changes, the color of the filename changes from modified to grey, which is fine. But the modified lines won't get unselected and I still see those line if I've still open the file. If I close and open the file again, the lines are gone.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Make some changes within a file within a Git Repository.
2. Save.
3. Discard the changes while the file with the changes is still open.

The current visible file should be refreshed.
The discarded changes should also be thrown away with the file you are currently looking at. Furthermore the modified lines color should disappear.

**Actual behavior:** 
The file doesn't show the new, discarded changes. It still has the ""old version"".

**Reproduces how often:** 
Every time.

### Description

When using multiple cursors, I used to be able to press <kbd>esc</kbd> to go back to a single cursor.

On a recent build from master, pressing the escape key after creating multiple selections has no effect.

Note:  everything works _as expected_ in the 1.23 beta, so this must have been introduced recently.  Everything also works correctly when I use other commands (like `editor:add-selection-below`) to 

Everything also works correctly if I invoke `editor:consolidate-selections` from the command palette, so it appears that for whatever reason the escape key is no longer dispatching that command.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a new editor
2. Create multiple cursors (either by using `editor:add-selection-below` or `find-and-replace:select-next`, for example).
3. Press the escape key

**Expected behavior:** All but one cursor goes away.

**Actual behavior:** Multiple cursors remain active

**Reproduces how often:** Always

### Description

Btw, this is very old issue, just I haven't opened issue.

When undo/redo-ing by `core:undo`, `core:redo`, cursor is restored and autoscroll happens appropriately.
So we can see textual change done by undo/redo.
But after copy-ing editor by `cmd-k right` and did undo/redo, cursor is no longer restored, autoscroll not happens, so textual changes happens in off-screen.

I noticed this behavior at about end of last year.
https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/issues/617

In following GIF, I made `CHANGE-1` and `CHANGE-2` on editor-1, then split-and-copy editor.
Undo/redoing on this new editor does not scroll to textual changes. 
![change-happen-offscreen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155205/32737102-882f975e-c8dc-11e7-9c33-32745ffbf8ef.gif)


### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open editor-1, insert text in 3 different places. Each changes must be made in very different place which require editor scroll.
2. Undo/redo and see undo/redo restore cursor and scroll to restored cursor.
3. Split and copy active editor by `cmd-k right` then do undo/redo.
4. See cursor is not restored, no scroll-to-cursor happens. So textual changes by undo/redo happens at completely off-screen.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

When undo/redo-ing on editor I want to see changes, want cursor restored as long as underlying text-buffer is same.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

Atom/text-buffer does not restore cursor and doesn't autoscroll to changes made by undo/redo.
So user cannot see changes.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]

100%

```

### Additional Information

I also tried to find a way to **detect** if cursor restoration was happened or not on undo/redo timing by observing marker's change event.
But I couldn't find concrete way for that.
If this issue is not fixable, I still want to know the way to distinguish cursor restoration was succeeded or not on undo/redo timing.

"105","Main process gets into a state where input is blocked for hundreds of milliseconds","The Atom main process is intermittently getting into a state where it blocks keyboard input for long period of time, on the order of 500ms or more. It's happened to me at least twice over the past few weeks.

Nov 9th 2017: The timeline below happened today. I'm experiencing intermittent pauses of ~500ms. Notice there's no main thread JS being executed, but input handling is being delayed.

Oct 17th 2017: Here I dug in deeper with native tracing on the main process. It definitely seems like we're blocking running some kind of script in the main process.

To fully diagnose this, it would be helpful to upgrade to the latest Electron so it's easier to profile the main process with the standard dev tools. In the meantime though, we should probably consider precautionary action.

* There is still some sync I/O happening in the main process. Could that be the culprit? It has no business being there anyway and should be eliminated.
* Are we doing any spawning in the main process? We know that can be problematic.
* Are we doing any output sync IPC in the main process?

Lurking intermittent performance issues like this are the weakest link in our performance story. Getting into this state even a couple times a week is enough to undermine months of performance work spent on known code paths. We need to get to the bottom of this ASAP.

### Description

When creating a text editor through the DOM like `<atom-text-editor mini>Example text</atom-text-editor>`, the initial text content is not properly converted into actual buffer text.  The buffer correctly gets its content set: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/4fd0345e8488d2fa09151316b4e99656e7861644/src/text-editor-element.js#L92
but `this.textContent` is never cleared and the raw text is also displayed.
![duplicate-text-editor-text](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/26454371/e0aa5094-41a1-11e7-9921-df0e92a2a491.png)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create an `atom-text-editor` tag that contains some text.
2. Render it.

**Expected behavior:** A TextEditor to be created which does not have any textContent, only buffer text

**Actual behavior:** A TextEditor with both textContent and buffer text

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

"110","Workspace Item API documentation is truncated","The [Workspace](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.21.2/Workspace) documentation has a section on ""Workspace Items"", which is truncated to just the following:

> ## Workspace Items
> 
> The term ""item"" refers to anything that can be displayed in a pane within the workspace, either in the [WorkspaceCenter](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.21.2/WorkspaceCenter) or in one of the three [Dock](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.21.2/Dock)s. The workspace expects items to conform to the following interface:
> 
> ### Required Methods
> #### `getTitle()`

However, the [documentation in source](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v1.21.2/src/workspace.js#L31) goes in-depth, describing the contract for `getTitle()` and numerous optional methods.","bug"
"111","Improve performance of converting screen position to pixel position","When calling `pixelPositionForScreenPosition` on a `TextEditorElement`, `TextEditorComponent` will unconditionally re-render itself:

https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/62774596919fdce190a1c5c6378f56535547aac3/src/text-editor-component.js#L196-L198

Instead, the following should happen:

* If the line is already on screen, it should just be measured.
* Otherwise, we should **partially** re-render the editor to account for the requested line, and then measure it.

Even with the above changes, however, `pixelPositionForScreenPosition` makes it inconvenient to measure multiple lines that are off-screen. In particular, calling it multiple times will cause layout thrashing because the editor component is unable to cluster writes and reads to and from the DOM due to the non-batched nature of the API. 

Therefore, I propose we introduce an additional API `getPixelPosition` or `pixelPositionForScreenPosition(position, {async: true})` on `TextEditorElement` that returns a `Promise`. Such promise will resolve when the position has been measured, allowing the component to batch consecutive requests to measure screen positions and fulfill them all in a single shot. 

The promise-based solution would also allow the component to decide *when* to measure a collection of screen positions, allowing us to defer the measurement until the next animation frame or in an idle callback.

### Description

editor:delete-to-previous-word-boundary and editor:delete-to-next-word-boundary does not work properly with newlines

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Atom and insert the following js code snippet
```javascript
function doubleNumber (num) {




  return num*2
}

```


2. Put your cursor before the `r` in return.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
Should go to the {

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
deletes the white space before the return and sees each newline as a new word.  


If you repeat this step by putting your cursor on the new line after the `{` and run `editor:delete-to-next-word-boundary`  It just deletes 1 newline but doesn't go to the return statement.

"113","Can we drop our application bundle size by removing snapshotted scripts?","In Spring 2017, [we shipped v8 snapshots](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14080) to improve startup time, which combine most of the source files that we ship into a single binary snapshot. Unfortunately, at that time we were unable to step the debugger through snapshotted code, which made us decide not to enable snapshots in development mode so that package authors could step through Atom source code when debugging their packages.

@as-cii, you mentioned that @hashseed had reached out to you with a patch that fixed the debugging issue. If we apply that in Electron, do you think we'll be in a position to remove any snapshotted scripts from the application bundle? It would save a ton of bandwidth for our users.

I think this is something we should follow up on fairly soon. The potential savings are huge and we've already done 95% of the work.

### Description

Provide an option in workspace.open() to show a pane without activating it. Currently the activatePane option controls whether to activate the pane to which an item is added, and the dock containing the pane only shows itself when it is activated. Decoupling activation from display would allow the extension author to show an item without it taking input focus from the currently active pane.

### Steps to Reproduce

`workspace.open(URI, {activatePane: false, showPane: true})`

### Description

Hi!
First of I know this sounds silly, but I experience this problem only when opening one of my projects, so bear with me.
When opening a ~checkout of my project (https://github.com/thetechnick/nginx-ingress)~ project folder in the size range of >150MB atoms memory consumption is rising constantly at about ~30 MiB per second until it reaches around 14GB and freezes my system.

First I suspected the golang plugin `go-plus` and `ide-go`, but now I have disabled all community packages and the `atom-fuzzyfinder` and the issue still occurs. (same for `--safe` and `--clear-window-state`

I have done a short CPU Profile in Chrome, but it shows nothing I can identify as a Problem:
[CPU-20171022T113255.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1404767/CPU-20171022T113255.zip)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the project
2. Look at the `top`/`the gnome taks thingy` or whatever shows the amount of memory atom uses

**Actual behavior:** Atom allocates ~30 MiB of memory per second until it crashes the system

**Reproduces how often:** 15~20 times before opening this issue

### Versions

OS: Fedora 26

`atom --version`
Atom    : 1.21.1

1. open `tree-view-package-spec.coffee`
1. go to the bottom of the file.

### Description

I think the functionality mentioned in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9060#issuecomment-145878664 has been changed to match the original poster's (on #9060) expectations.



### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set custom font size in Editor Settings that isn't 14 (the default default). For this example, assume 12.
2. Go to a document and CTRL + or CTRL - to increase/decrease font size (or CTRL+Scroll, as I often do by accident with a touchpad).
3. Press CTRL+0 to trigger window:reset-font-size.

**Expected behavior:**
Font size should be reset to 12.

**Actual behavior:**
Font size is cleared from configuration (set back to 14).

**Reproduces how often:**
100% of the time.

### Description

When dragging to select a hard tab, the selection flickers between not selecting and selecting the hard tab.  I think the root problem may be that the halfway point of the tab isn't being calculated properly - in most programs, once you pass the halfway point of a tab, it should be highlighted, or in the case of moving the cursor, the cursor should be placed on the other side of the tab.  In Atom, this behavior is erratic.  I'll showcase a GIF of Atom and a GIF of the developer tools to visually explain the difference.

1. Create a hard tab
2. Place the cursor at one end of the hard tab

### Description

When running `atom --test spec` and there is a problem encountered that will not allow the tests to start, this is the result:

```
[master][~/Source/atom/keybinding-resolver] atom --test spec
Error Downloading Update: Could not get code signature for running application
[master][~/Source/atom/keybinding-resolver][1]
```

It turned out that the problem was that I had forgotten to run `apm install` on the repository before attempting to run the tests. When I finally attempted to run the tests in the GUI, I was able to find this in the JavaScript Console

```
Error: Cannot find module 'etch'

  at Module._resolveFilename (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/electron.asar/common/reset-search-paths.js:35:12)
  ...
```

This led me to the solution of running `apm install`. We should output any exception like this at the command line to help people figure out why things aren't working.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Execute `git clone https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver.git ~/keybinding-resolver-test`
1. `cd ~/keybinding-resolver-test`
1. `atom --test spec`

**Expected behavior:** An exception message (or even better a real error message explaining the problem)

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

When soft wrap is enabled, resizing the window with a long file causes your current position in the file to be lost. This is because Atom seems to keep the viewport at a fixed position from the top of the file during a resize, causing the file content to be pushed down (by the addition of new soft wrap lines) and your current position in the file being lost.

Why is this feature important? Here are two common use cases where this issue occurs:

- Opening/closing a vertical split
- Toggling the tree view

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable soft wrapping (`preferences -> editor -> soft wrap`)
2. Open a long file and navigate to a position a decent way down the file (in my example below the file is 1000 lines long and I have the cursor on line 878)
3. Resize the window and observe your current position in the file being pushed down below the viewport

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

When a tab is resized, your current position in the file should stay visible within the viewport instead of being push down below the viewport due to the addition of soft tab lines.

This expected behaviour is the default behaviour in both VS Code and in Vim (maybe in other editors as well, they are the only two I tested).

Here is an example of the expected behaviour, in VS Code:

![gif_vscode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3773641/31256183-a5f9b176-aa7c-11e7-9b96-7793a05ac7e9.gif)

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

When a tab is resized, the current position in the file is pushed down below the viewport by the extra soft wrapped lines being added to the file. This results in you losing your place in a file everytime you open a vertical split, toggle the tree view, etc.  Here is an example of this, using the same file and line number from the VS Code example above:

100% of the time this is reproducable

### Description

When a normal Atom window as well as an Atom spec window are open, closing the spec window last results in Atom attempting to save the state of the spec window rather than the actual project window.  Spec windows should probably be ignored when saving state.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open any project
2. Run specs using the GUI
3. Close the project window
4. Close the specs window
5. `atom` in terminal

**Expected behavior:** The project from step 1 to be reopened

**Actual behavior:** Atom appears un-maximized (same dimensions as the spec window) and with no project state.

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

### Versions

Atom    : 1.23.0-dev-c30cc9bc8
Electron: 1.6.9
Chrome  : 56.0.2924.87

```

### Additional Information

This may be harder to reproduce on macOS due to its special Quit behavior.","bug"

### Description

When IME composition pops up on input-disabled-editor, it incorrectly create checkpoint.
After enable input and start insertion, buffer-state is reverted to wrongly created checkpoint(so cursor jumps, changes are reverted).

At final timing in GIF, text `a` is inserted elsewhere, and text-deletions are reverted.

![ime-issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155205/31051857-69ddbd26-a6ae-11e7-9e6f-d5f7240cf547.gif)

**This is really critical issue for vim-mode-plus user who use IME(e.g. Japanese, Chinese)**
Since vim-mode-plus fundamentally depends on disable/enable input(`editor.component.setInputEnabled(true/false)`) to achieve modal-editing.

### Steps to Reproduce

##### Steps for explanatory purpose

1. Disable input `editor.component.setInputEnabled(false)`
2. Enable IME and pops up IME composition by entering some text.
3. Move cursor, also delete line by `editor:delete-line`(`ctrl-shift-K`).
4. Enable input `editor.composition.setInputEnabled(true)`.
5. Type some text to insert text.

At first char input timing.

- Char inserted at cursor position where last IME composition pop up happened.(position in step-2).
- Also all the buffer-text changes done after step-2 are **reverted**.


##### Steps for easy to observe.

1. Open non-empty editor.
2. Paste code bellow on chrome dev-console, at this point editor-input is disabled.

```javascript
(function emulateVimMode() {
  const editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()
  editor.element.classList.add(""vim-test"")

  startInsert = () => {
    if (!editor.component.isInputEnabled()) {
      editor.component.setInputEnabled(true)
      console.log(""start insert"")
    }
  }
  stopInsert = () => {
    if (editor.component.isInputEnabled()) {
      editor.component.setInputEnabled(false)
      console.log(""stop insert"")
    }
  }

  atom.commands.add(editor.element, {
    ""vim-test:start-insert"": () => startInsert()
    ""vim-test:stop-insert"": () => stopInsert()
  })
  stopInsert()
})()
```

3. Enable IME and type some keys to make IME composition pops up then stop IME.
4. Move cursor, also delete line by `editor:delete-line`(`ctrl-shift-K`).
5. Enable input by executing `vim-test:start-insert` via command-palette.
6. Type some text to insert text.(see cursor jumps, changes are reverted)

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

Text is inserted at cursor position and changes are NOT reverted.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

Text is inserted at different position and all changes are reverted.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]

100% with safe-mode

### Versions

Issue not happens in v.1.18, so I believe this issue started after editor-rewrite.

### Description

Windows 10 Pro 64ibt
Atom 1.20.1 x64
Dell 4K monitors

I don’t know the name of the UI element that shows up when you hover over the Tree View and Git Tab. It’s a half circle with > or < that allows one to toggle these panes. Dock Handle?

InTree View this UI element shows up when you have the pane open or close by hovering the pane when open and close to the edge of the window when closed. It’s working correctly when the Atom interface is anything else except Maximized

On the Git Tab it does not show up when the tab is closed and one hovers close to the edge or on the edge AND the app window is maximized. It worked as expected when this feature first came available but the last 4, or so, updates it has not worked correctly. If I don’t have the editor sized maximized I can use it by hovering over the right edge of the editor. The half circle slides into view.
### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Atom > Window Maximized >Toggle Git Tab 

**Expected behavior:** I expect the tab handle to appear on mouseover

**Actual behavior:** Tab handle does not show up

**Reproduces how often:**  100% of the time

### Description

It seems that when the editor height is very close to needing a vertical scrollbar, soft-wrapped lines will rapidly flicker.  Possibly the vertical scrollbar is showing up for a fraction of a second before realizing it's not needed and hiding again.  On occasion, the cursor is also rendered incorrectly.  In the GIF, it is incorrectly appearing as a blue block below the line where the cursor actually is.

### Steps to Reproduce

This might be difficult to repro because on my screen there's only two pixels before the scrollbar is required.

1. Have a file with soft-wrapped lines that _almost_ reaches the threshold necessary for vertical scrollbars to appear
2. Move your cursor around the file, make some random selections, etc.

**Expected behavior:** Editor contents to stay static

**Actual behavior:** Soft-wrapped lines jump around as the scrollbar appearance is constantly recalculated

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

"143","Text is pulsating at regular intervals in v1.21.0-beta0","### Updated Repro Steps from @ungb (consolidating info from this issue):
1. `apm install minimal-syntax-dark`
1. Open atom and set the following for your theme:
UI Theme: One Dark
Syntax Theme: Minimal Dark
1. Open `styles.less` and add the following and save:
```less
atom-text-editor .cursor {
  transition: opacity 0.333s;
}
```

1. Look at the less file where the number `0.333s` is:
![pulsing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5624870/31413621-06f7a686-adcf-11e7-88b8-0e2c32927b61.gif)

I have a `transition: opacity 0.333s` on my cursor element, which causes this annoying pulsating effect. I assume that the transition causes Chromium to switch to a different way of rendering the texts, and voila. This was not an issue in either v1.19(.7?, latest stable version) or v1.20 (beta7 I think?), both used today.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install `minimal-syntax-dark` (or add the transition on the cursor manually)
2. Create an empty JavaScript file
3. Enter some basic code, like `const test = ""test""`

**Expected behavior:**

No pulsating text.

**Actual behavior:**

See .gif in description.

**Reproduces how often:**

Consistently.

### Description

[`revert-buffer` package](https://github.com/atom/revert-buffer/issues/3) should be rolled into core.  This package has zero documentation and appears to not be maintained. 

The functionality provided by this tiny package is just a single command to reset the buffered text to the content saved on disk. I am quite surprised this functionality is not already in core. We shouldn't need to install a package to do this. 

Atom should move this to core and make it available to various menus and deal with any open issues brought up on that package's repo.

### Steps to Reproduce

**Expected behavior:** 
Opening `File` menu or context clicking on a file in `Tree View` or typing `""revert` into `Command Palette` displays an option to revert file to it's saved state. `File` menu and `Command Palette` also displays the wisely selected default hotkey for this command.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
In order to revert file to saved, I must close and reopen the file or install the undocumented and poorly interfaced `revert-buffer` package.

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

Block decorations mess up line numbers and editor content once destroyed.
The issue was originally reported by @srk-srinivasan on the Hydrogen repo: https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/981

This worked correctly till Atom 1.19.5 and 1.20.0-beta5.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open file with a few lines of code
2. Execute the following code in dev tools:
```js
function createBlock(row) {
  const item = document.createElement(""span"");
  item.innerText = ""[block decoration]\n[block decoration]\n[block decoration]"";
  const editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor();
  const marker = editor.markBufferPosition([row, 0]);
  editor.decorateMarker(marker, { type: ""block"", item: item });
  return marker;
}

const marker = createBlock(5);
```

3. Destroy marker with
```js
marker.destroy();
```

**Expected behavior: (Atom 1.19.5 / 1.20.0-beta5)**
Editor correctly renders as if the block decoration was never there.

**Actual behavior: (Atom 1.19.6 / 1.20.0-beta6)**
Editor doesn't correctly re-render and messes up line numbering and editor content:

Condition this happens is
- Cursor's style is updated when editor is not active pane item(= not visible in screen)
- In addition to update style, cursor has to be moved(without no move, issue not happen).

When issue happened cursor's style's `translation`, `width` is not measured correctly, result in rendered incorrectly.

Following GIF is before and after the cursor move right by `ctrl-f` after I reproduce issue.
Notice lower GIF have odd width, translate value.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Prepare following style in your `style.less`.

```less
atom-text-editor.test-cursor-marker {
  &.is-focused {
    .cursor {
      border: none;
      background: none;
      opacity: 0.5;
      background-color: @syntax-cursor-color;
      visibility: visible;
    }
  }
}
```

2. open editor-1 and set text ""aaa"". and open another editor-2.
3. Set editor-1 active. place cursor at eol of first line.
4. open chrome-dev console and paste following code.

```javascript
(function reproduceIssue() {
  const editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()
  atom.workspace.onDidChangeActivePaneItem(item => {
    if (item !== editor) {
      editor.moveLeft() // This is necessary
      editor.element.classList.add(""test-cursor-marker"")
    }
  })
})()
```

5. click editor-2's tab, then click editor-1's tab(re-activate)
6. See cursor style become odd.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

Cursor is rendered correctly after tab-switch and back.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

Cursor is rendered incorrectly after tab-switch and back.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]

100%, in safe-mode.

### Description

I would like to request that the `TextEditor.element` property be added to the public API, because it contains very helpful methods for package development such as the `getFirstVisibleScreenRow()` and `getLastVisibleScreenRow()`, which return which are the lines that are currently visible in an editor.

Note: I am also using these methods on my own package: [srt-helper](https://atom.io/packages/srt-helper). Previously I was using the `TextEditor.presenter.startRow` and `TextEditor.presenter.endRow` properties, but since the `presenter` no longer exists I had to start using the `element` property. This is another reason that I would like to request that the `TextEditor.element` be added to the public API: so that my package remains stable on the next versions of Atom.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a file
2. `pane:split-<direction>-and-copy-active-item` (note: I have only tested with `right`)
3. If there is no horizontal scrollbar, resize the panes so that the original pane can be horizontally scrolled
4. Look at the scrollbar positions of the original pane and then attempt to horizontally scroll

**Expected behavior:** Scrollbars to correctly represent where the current file is, and for horizontally scrolling to horizontally scroll the file while maintaining the vertical position

**Actual behavior:** Both scrollbars reset to (0, 0) - that is, the vertical scrollbar resets to the top and the horizontal scrollbar resets to the left.  When attempting to horizontally scroll, the file position is reset to the top of the file.

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

In MacOS when the ""Prefer tabs when opening documents"" is set to ""Always"", File->Open on a non-fullscreen session will toggle the fullscreen if atom remembers the new project as being fullscreen. This is really annoying when I open new tabs and get jerked out of my element into fullscreen. Atom should not toggle fullscreen when opening a new tab, only a new window.

### Steps to Reproduce

First we set up the scenario:
1. Navigate to ```Dock``` in the macOS System Preferences
2. Change ```Prefer tabs when opening documents:``` to ```Always```
3. Open up atom to a directory
4. File->Open another directory (You should now have 2 native tabs in the same window)
5. Enter the macOS native fullscreen mode
6. Close one of the native tabs [Taking note of that path] (So only one project is left open now)
7. Exit native fullscreen
8. Quit Atom

Now we can reproduce the bug:
1. Open up atom to the directory that was last open (Atom should open and NOT enter fullscreen)
2. Now File->Open the path you took note of in step 6

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
The new native tab should open and the app should not enter native fullscreen.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
The app enters native fullscreen.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]
100% of the time

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

Decorations of type `highlight` (possibly others) that cover a large range are inconsistently rendered in the editor.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install [large-decoration.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1264748/large-decoration.zip) as a package.
2. Open Atom.
3. Trigger `Large Decoration: Decorate` from the Command Palette

**Expected behavior:**

The entire text should be decorated with an underline.

**Actual behavior:**

The underline is inconsistently applied, skipping entire lines in a repeating pattern:

It looks like what's happening here is the highlights are in a separate `<div>`, and for some reason instead of creating one sub-`<div>` for each line, it creates only two: One for the first line and one that ""covers"" the rest of the lines in a ""rendering block"" which seems to contain 6 lines in the `TextEditor`.

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

Why not have an uninstaller for atom separately since the atom doesn't completely uninstall in windows.
A lot of leftovers are left behind.

Mostly while reinstalling atom. It doesn't install properly due to registry errors(leftovers) and leftovers of the previous installation

I have added few leftovers of uninstallation. one or two may be removed automatically by windows, but most of them isn't removed. Having to tool to clean this automatically would be nice.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Uninstall atom with windows uninstaller

**Expected behavior:**  The uninstaller should Remove all the unwanted registry entries(Invalid entries) that are not needed when atom is uninstalled

**Actual behavior:** Leftovers are not removed properly which sometimes causes installation problem when we install atom back

**Reproduces how often:** Always

### Versions
Version: All
OS: WIndows 

### Additional Information
Some leftovers that are easily found are
**Folders**
```
C:\Users\{user_name}\.atom
C:\Users\{user_name}\AppData\Local\atom
C:\Users\{user_name}\AppData\Roaming

### Description

Syntax assigned to unsaved buffers is not preserved when restarting Atom.

I do a lot of work that involves editing HTML fragments, often from locations that either aren't directly editable or have no syntax highlighting. I will usually copy this into Atom, make the necessary changes, and paste it back. This provides a lot more than just syntax highlighting, such as auto-complete and auto-indent. However, if I restart Atom or my PC, the assigned syntax is lost and I have to re-assign it every time, on all buffers - there's no point in saving the copied HTML to actual files, as I'd have to regularly clean these files from my computer.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Atom and add a project root
2. Open a new tab and add some content in a defined language, e.g. HTML or Python
3. Assign the correct syntax to the buffer
3. Do not save the content to a file
4. Restart Atom

**Expected behavior:** Atom re-opens with everything - content, settings, etc - preserved

**Actual behavior:** Atom re-opens with syntax set to plain text on unsaved buffers

**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time, every time

### Versions

1.17.2 when I first started using Atom, currently on 1.19.2 ia32 and this behaviour has always been consistent. OS is 64-bit Windows 10 Pro 15063.483 running on an i5-6400 with 8GB RAM.","enhancement"

Opened sidebar of conflicts in files after doing a pull on a branch... Some popups started appearing that stated the issue was already reported, so I closed the sidebar. The popups kept showing up, and then some showed up that prompted me to create an issue, so I assumed it was a different one.

Only showed up when I was on the tab of the conflicted file! I changed to tab of settings and the popups stopped, and started again when I switched back to my conflicted file. As soon as I resolved the conflict issues, the popups stopped. I still have another conflicted file to correct, will update this to see if behaviour is the same.

So it seems only after opening the git tab (where it shows on the bottom right corner of the screen how many files have conflicts) the errors occur, since I switched to my second conflicted file and was able to scroll (although unsure if the markup of ""ours vs theirs"" changes had updated already, since I didn't see anything). Then again the same, even after closing the tab, whenever I scroll more errors are thrown.

### Description

[Description of the issue]

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Atom, close all open panes
2. Open development console
3. Open Settings >> Updates (do not trigger button for getting updates)
4. Close Atom
5. Disconnect from internet
6. Open Atom 
5. Observe messages in console (2) and settings (3) (Reopen if required)
6. Reload Atom by `ctrl-shift-f5'
7. Observe messages in console (2) and settings (3)
8. Re-do (6) and (7).

**Expected behaviour:** 
Reload of Packages should not update so soon after being updated a short time earlier. If the internet connection is not there, the message should not be an ERROR but rather a WARNING. Suggest to have the user selectable option to not have the system update the packages. This option is available for the core.

**Actual behaviour:** [What actually happens]
Each time Atom is reloaded, the package updating is triggered. An ERROR is triggered if the connection is not made, influencing start-up times.

**Reproduces how often:** 
Always

### Versions

Atom V1.19 under Windows7 SP1

### Additional Information (Full Description)

SUBJECT: [FEATURE REQUEST] Expose option to allow / disallow updates of Packages.

Good day. 
May this message find you well.

#### Symptoms
The behaviour is observed Atom V1.19 under Windows7 SP1. Each time Atom is reloaded (opening Atom | command: `reload()` | shortcut: `ctrl-shift-f5`) the update service for the Packages is triggered. This happens _each_ time a reload occurs, regardless of time gone by since the last trigger.

#### Problem
The impact of triggering the `update of Packages` is most prominently observed when regular `reload()` is done in the process of developing customizations for Atom.

This behaviour causes extended start-up time especially when working offline from the internet. Also consumption of internet data is a concern for those who use expensive (capped) mobile data as internet source.

Some more details can be found on..
[Atom community discussion](https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-prevent-atom-to-update-packages-at-each-reload/45638)
The mechanism of the `update of Packages` is here:
[Link to code](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/blob/ea7f18e089fcd4fbcb549aa04dd963437e26f2c0/lib/main.coffee#L70)

#### Suggestions
1. Record the time of last `update of Packages`. Do not execute the update if the elapsed time is too short.

2. Expose the option as a setting to prevent the `update of Packages` to occur. This is the same concept as ""Automatic Update"" option in the ""Core Settings"".
![Automatic Updates only applied for CORE](https://cdn-business.discourse.org/uploads/github_atom/original/3X/1/0/10027aa2523229818dcc9058781ce9ca212606c7.png)


3. Downgrade the message from ERROR to WARNING that tells the user that an internet connection could not be made.
![ERROR: having no internet connection is a sin](https://cdn-business.discourse.org/uploads/github_atom/original/3X/c/e/ce0432891c088e6a6b764fcc636f4c754a926092.png)

### Description

When interacting with a block decoration near the bottom of the text editor, the decoration scrolls up instead of registering the click event:

![scroll](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13285808/29250800-3ed964f8-8049-11e7-8ceb-97c405851c0b.gif)


This issue came up with the [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen) package which uses block decorations to display interactive outputs with ""clickable"" elements. But this is a general problem also present in safe mode.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a file with at least 10 to 20 lines of code
2. Run the following code in the dev tools:
```js
function createBlock(row) {
  const div = document.createElement(""div"");
  const item = document.createElement(""span"");
  item.innerText = ""[block decoration]\n"".repeat(10);
  const button = document.createElement(""button"");
  button.innerText = ""Click me!""
  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    alert(""CLICK!"")
  });
  div.appendChild(item);
  div.appendChild(button);
  const editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor();
  const marker = editor.markBufferPosition([row, 0]);
  editor.decorateMarker(marker, { type: ""block"", item: div });
}

createBlock(8)
```
3. Scroll the block decoration to the bottom of the text editor and try to click the button.

**Expected behavior:** The button click is registered and a alert box pops up.

**Actual behavior:** The editor scrolls up and the click isn't registered. A second click on the button is necessary to show the pop up.

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

"178","Horizontal scrolling is always favored over vertical scrolling","Hey,

I can't see anything about it in the release notes but it's possible I've missed something. I've just updated to Atom 1.19.0 (OS X 10.12.6, MacBook Pro) and for some reason the horizontal scroll seems to have started catching when it shouldn't. It's hard to explain but, if you're using two fingers on the trackpad to vertically scroll up and down a file then, since the update, as you scroll it seems to catch horizontally much more often and start scrolling that way instead.

Has any of the sensitivity been changed? Am I missing something?

### Description

On long files where horizontal scrolling is possible the horizontal scrolling sensitivity is now higher and kicks in when scrolling vertically.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Make sure you're using a Mac.
2. Get a long file with lines that exceed the width of the screen.
3. Use two fingers on the trackpad to scroll vertically down the screen, if your fingers are at anything other than perfectly aligned then the horizontal scroll kicks in much sooner than it did before.

**Expected behavior:**

To scroll vertically, smoothly.

**Actual behavior:**

As you scroll vertically, it start scrolling horizontally

**Reproduces how often:**

100%

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

**Pressing ""Cancel"" on the unsaved buffer dialog will not cancel a restart**

Atom requests a restart in some situations, such as when a plugin has been updated. If one has an unsaved buffer open in a project-less window, after pressing ""restart"", the normal unsaved file dialog is presented with, on macOS at least, ""Save"", ""Don't Save"", and ""Cancel"" buttons. In this scenario, ""Save"" and ""Don't Save"" work as expected, but pressing ""Cancel"" will immediately re-present the same dialog. This can be especially problematic when the unsaved buffer is in another tab in the same window as one cannot switch tabs to inspect the file and determine if it should be saved or not.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a new project-less window and buffer
2. Type in some content
3. Trigger a restart by either updating plugins or opening a developer console and entering `atom.restartApplication()`
4. Press ""Cancel""

**Expected behavior:**
The restart operation should be canceled, returning me to the state I was in before I pressed ""restart"".

**Actual behavior:**
I am immediately presented with the same unsaved buffer dialog

**Reproduces how often:**
Every time

### Description

`TextEditor::onDidReload` appears to not be firing, at least within the 10 second timeout of package specs.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Check out [`linter-eslint@8.2.1`](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/tree/v8.2.1)
2. Run the package specs
3. Note that [two](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/blob/v8.2.1/spec/linter-eslint-spec.js#L241) [specs](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/blob/v8.2.1/spec/linter-eslint-spec.js#L285) are failing.

**Expected behavior:**

`TextEditor::onDidReload` fires when the file is reloaded due to the external process changing the file.

**Actual behavior:**

The specs are expecting [a notification](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/blob/v8.2.1/spec/linter-eslint-spec.js#L92-L95) that the fix was complete from ESLint (which triggers), as well as Atom declaring via `TextBuffer::onDidReload` that it has finished reloading the file after the external ESLint process has finished changing the file [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/blob/v8.2.1/spec/linter-eslint-spec.js#L82-L87).

**Reproduces how often:**

100% of the time.

### Description

I'm on Ubuntu 16.04. Atom 1.18.0 was fine, but since updating to Atom 1.19.0, if I have a file with unsaved changes and I try to close the tab by middle-clicking on the tab, then a modal pops up (Are you sure you want to close the file without saving?), but I can't click on anything. The cursor doesn't change no matter what I hover over and no clicks register on the modal's buttons or even other (non-Atom) windows. Clicking another window doesn't focus it, bring it to the front, or get any reaction.

My computer is still responsive to keyboard inputs, though even if I alt-tab to another window, nothing reacts to my mouse still. I have to press escape on Atom's closing-confirmation modal or otherwise close it before anything reacts to my mouse again.

If I close the file tab in any other way (clicking the X button, or pressing ctrl-w), the modal and my mouse work perfectly normal. With little non-web UI experience, I'd guess the issue has to do with some kind of blocking call (like the modal) happening or a lock being hogged improperly during the middle-click event handler.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Be on Ubuntu 16.04 (?)
2. Open Atom, open a file in Atom, and make some changes to the file without saving.
3. Middle-click on the file's tab.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

My mouse to work as usual: for the modal to be clickable, and to have the ability to click on other windows freely even while the modal is still open.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

See description.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]

100%, tested with safe mode and a new ~/.atom directory too.

### Description

Can't open projects from the previous version of Atom Beta

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install 1.19 beta 7
2. Open a project, some tabs, and the About page (maybe the Settings View too)
3. Update to 1.20 beta 0 automatically (Squirrel should download the update and you need to Restart and Install once it's downloaded)
4. Reopen Atom once the update completes (the error should happen automatically)
5. If the error doesn't appear, open a project from `File > Reopen Project`

Note that if you manually add a project with `Add Project Folder` or open a project you had already opened in 1.20 the issue doesn't appear

**Expected behavior:** Projects should open in tree view and tabs should be restored

**Actual behavior:** Instead, the error pop-ups and no editor is opened

**Reproduces how often:** Always

### Description
When folding text using `editor:fold-at-indent-level-2`, the visual representation of some of the folds is not updated correctly

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open [this file](https://github.com/calebmeyer/git-links/blob/f5100a252734bc4b4de55dcc4b85b743d456d551/lib/git-links.coffee)
1. Run `editor:toggle-soft-wrap` to enable soft wrap if it is not already on
1. Run `editor:fold-at-indent-level-2` using the command palette

Size of the Atom window may be related /cc: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15190#issuecomment-322209970

**Expected behavior:**
Each element at the second level of indentation is folded, and shows as folded

**Actual behavior:**
Some (or none) of the elements are showing as folded.
Moving the cursor with the arrow keys navigates inside the fold
Moving the cursor with vim-mode-plus `hjkl` navigates over the fold

**Reproduces how often:**
I am able to see the problem in safe mode about 80% of the time. Almost always, at least one fold gets folded correctly, sometimes two. Very rarely all folds will show correctly.

### Description

This issue started from v1.19 which use new editor-rendering with etch.

CC @as-cii 

#### Short summary

From v1.19, highlight decoration node is re-rendered in it's lifetime which cause keyframe animation unwillingly re-started.
This was not issue in v1.18 where highlight decoration node was stable in it's lifetime.

See, each removal of brackets-matcher's highlight cause fadeout animation re-started.
Which is because highlight node of `class=t9md-test-flash` is re-created at that timing.

![decoration-node-unstable2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155205/29040638-b6cee3ce-7bea-11e7-9aa3-4168238b2b6d.gif)



### Detail

When highlight decoration is created by `editor.decorateMarker`, corresponding `<div class=""highlights"">` node is created at top of LinesComponents.
Child nodes of this div represent actual decoration style.

- Till v1.18 these nodes are stable in its lifetime.
- From v1.19 with new editor-rendering, these nodes can be re-rendered during it's lifetime.

This is not problem when highlight class is simply set `background:` color.
But it's become problem when highlight class specify animation.
Lets' say

- I have set decoration which `class=flash-anime` which will be destroyed after 1.0 sec
- `flash-anime` css class have keyframe animation which fadeout flash during 1.0 sec.
- When Atom re-render(re-create) this decoration node within 1.0 sec, it cause re-start fadeout keyframe animation.
- This issue is more likely to happen when brackets-matcher involved, which create/remove decorations and it cause existing highlight node in the same LinesComponents **re-rendered**.


GIF: Animation in 10sec is separated into three because of re-render of highlight node.

### Steps to Reproduce

I can reproduce this issue with safe-mode.

1. Prepare sample.txt and custom-style.

- sample.txt

`{a: 1}`

- style.less

```less
@keyframes t9md-test-animation {
  from { background-color: #5b91c8; }
  to { background-color: transparent; }
}

atom-text-editor .t9md-test-flash .region {
  animation-name: t9md-test-animation;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
  animation-duration: 10.0s;
  animation-iteration-count: 1;
}
```

2. Open sample.txt, place cursor at first line.
3. Paste following code in chrome-dev-tools console.

This code does.
- highlight inner range of `a: 1`(inner range of curly brackets).
- marker will destroyed after 10sec.
- highlight class is `t9md-test-flash` which fadeout background color in 10sec.

```javascript
(function flashreproduceIssue() {
  const editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()
  const cursorPosition = editor.getCursorBufferPosition()
  const scanRange = editor.bufferRangeForBufferRow(cursorPosition.row)
  editor.scanInBufferRange(/{.*?}/, scanRange, ({range}) => {
    const innerRange = range.translate([0, +1], [0, -1])
    const marker = editor.markBufferRange(innerRange)
    editor.decorateMarker(marker, {type: ""highlight"", class: ""t9md-test-flash""})
    setTimeout(function () {
      marker.destroy()
      console.log(""destroyed"");
    }, 10000);
  })
})()
```

4. Within 10sec, move cursor left/right to cause add/remove brackets-macher's highlight.

And see how keyframe animation is re-started because of re-creation of highlight node.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

Node used for highlight decoration is stabled(not re-rendered).

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

Node used for highlight decoration is re-rendered, cause keyframe animation re-started.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]

100%.

### Versions

Electron: 1.6.9
Chrome  : 56.0.2924.87
Node    : 7.4.0
```

### Additional Information

I use fadeout flash effect with keyframe animation a lot in [vim-mode-plus](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-plus) to give feedback to user.
E.g. when yank inner range of brackets, flash inner bracket range.

From v.1.19 cursor move cause brackets-matcher's highlights add/removal which cause vmp's flash effect re-started unwillingly.

### Description

I received the below message **after** pasting all the text of a 33.8MB file into a new untitled file.

> The editor has crashed. Please report the issue to https://github.com/atom/atom

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a large file (e.g. [The file causing Atom to crash - Hosted On Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2YHKXTPh6ezTU5hQkJ4TzN6cXM))
2. Press (Cmd + A) then press (Cmd + C) to put the contents of the file on your clipboard
3. Press (Cmd + N) to open a new untitled document.
4. Press (Cmd + V) to paste your clipboard contents into the new untitled document.

**Expected behavior:** Editor does not crash

**Actual behavior:** 

after about 10 seconds the editor will paste the contents into the new untitled document. However, the user interface will remain frozen even after the editor is filled with the contents from your clipboard. After another 5 seconds the editor crashes. Opening Atom in safe mode from the terminal yields the below results

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

The positioning of gutter decorations has regressed between Atom v1.18.0 and Atom v1.19.0-betaX (confirmed on -beta3). It seems that they are being shoved to the right ~50 pixels... and as their Z-index is below the editor's this effectively makes them invisible.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Have a package installed that creates a custom gutter. (ex. `linter-ui-default`)
2. Get that package to decorate a line.
3. Note that the gutter decorations aren't showing visibly.

#### Expected behavior:

Custom gutter icons show as they did in Atom v1.18.0.

### Description

If the save dialog is open for too long, when it closes, I get an ""Editor is not responding"" dialog. If I click ""Keep Waiting"", everything is actually fine. I suspect there's a synchronous call somewhere when opening the save dialog.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new file in atom.
2. File -> Save As
3. Stare at the ""Save"" modal for a couple minutes.
4. Input a file name and save the file.
5. Now the ""Editor is not responding"" dialog pops up.
6. Click ""Keep Waiting"".
7. Everything is fine and working as normal.

**Expected behavior:** ""Editor is not responding"" dialog should not pop up.

**Actual behavior:** ""Editor is not responding"" dialog pops up.

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

### Description

Atom 1.18.0 is not saving window positions on multi-monitor Mac setups, in particular circumstances.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. On a Mac with 2 monitors, arrange them so that the secondary monitor is positioned higher and to the left of the primary monitor, like so: <img width=""668"" alt=""screen shot 2017-07-13 at 5 39 33 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5263654/28193555-934b56be-67f2-11e7-9255-ae81d1e2ea98.png"">
2. Open Atom and mentally note the window size and position.
3. Open settings to ensure that ""Restore Previous Windows On Start"" is set to ""always"".
4. Move Atom's application window fully onto the secondary monitor, so that the top left corner of it is positioned above the height of the primary window. Optionally, resize the window to be noticeably different than the original size. 
5. Open the Developer tools and enter `atom.getPosition()` into the console.
6. Observe that the current widow position x and y values are both negative, like so: 
![screen shot 2017-07-13 at 5 56 51 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5263654/28193853-eca1fd56-67f4-11e7-99c3-f00acfeca7d0.png)
7. Quit Atom via CMD+Q or via the File menu.
8. Open Atom.

**Expected behavior:** Atom should restore the window position and size due to the ""Restore Previous Windows On Start"" setting.

**Actual behavior:** The window will open in the position it was in at step 2. 

**Reproduces how often:** 100% (if the above steps are followed)

### Versions

**Atom:**
Atom    : 1.18.0
Electron: 1.3.15
Chrome  : 52.0.2743.82
Node    : 6.5.0

**apm:**
apm  1.18.1
npm  3.10.10
node 6.9.5 x64
python 2.7.10

**MacOS:**
System Version:	macOS 10.12.5 (16F73)
Mac Model Identifier:	MacBookPro13,2 

### Additional Information

The issue appears to be caused by an assumption that window positions are calculated relative to the monitor they reside on, not relative to the primary monitor position. The validation logic is found in the `isValidDimensions` method of `atom-environment.coffee` at line 635:
```
# Returns true if the dimensions are useable, false if they should be ignored.
# Work around for https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/473
    isValidDimensions: ({x, y, width, height}={}) ->
    width > 0 and height > 0 and x + width > 0 and y + height > 0
```
The intent seems to be to prevent saving positions that would place the window outside the viewable area of the monitors, but in our case it generates a false negative due to the way the position data is calculated, and therefore the window position is not saved if your setup is as described above.

"199","Atom doesn't reflect changes in environment for subsequent invocations of `atom .`","### Prerequisites

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

I'm running Atom on Windows (with command prompt), so I'm not sure if the issue is reproducible on other platforms. All invocations of `atom .` seem to reflect the state of the environment from the first time I invoked atom. Moreover, when using WSL (Bash on Windows), atom seems to completely ignore any environment variables I've set in the shell beforehand. This might be an unrelated issue, but I've ruled out using WSL as a workaround.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. In one command prompt window, `set FOO=bar`
2. In the same command prompt window, `atom .`
3. In another command prompt window, `set FOO=foo`
4, In this other command prompt window, `atom .`
5. Print `process.env` in the Javascript console for both atom windows.

**Expected behavior:** `FOO` in the first window should be equal to `bar` and `FOO` in the second window should be equal to `foo`.

**Actual behavior:** Both windows report `FOO` as `bar`.

**Reproduces how often:** Every time.

### Additional Information

I've noticed related closed issues or merged pull requests, but they seem to focus more on OS X. Whatever the fix was in the past, at the very least it doesn't work on Windows.

### Description

When switching between panes using keyboard, if a pane you switched to is cursor-less (like About or Welcome pane) the cursor position is not restored when returning back to an editable pane. This is similar to #6662 but without a mouse. Mouse works as expected

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a new file, enter some text in multiple lines
2. Open About pane (on macOS Atom -> About Atom
3. Switch between text pane and About pane using keyboard Cmd-Alt-Arrows or Cmd-Shift-[, Cmd-Shift-]

**Expected behavior:** When returning to a pane with an edit have a cursor where I left it and move it using arrows or other navigation keys

**Actual behavior:** Only line number is highlighted and no cursor is visible in the line and no reaction to arrow keys and other typing or navigation inside a pane

## Description
The new Desktop Client for Github has a really sexy Titlebar. 
Not only because it matches the color of the application but also because it doesn't use the OS default application menu but a custom one inside the Titlebar. 
Unfortunately, the windows default Titlebar and the application menu are very ugly. Especially the application menu looks like Windows 95 when Microsoft introduced this grayish style which they didn't changed since for it. Sure, it's sad that developers have to come up with custom solutions but the windows version would look soo much better with a custom title bar like the Github Client.

A custom Titlebar would also be nice on other platforms but on macOS, the application menu isn't in the window but in the menubar wich looks great and it should be there. On most Linux distros the Titlebar and the application menu have at least the same style so it doesn't look so bad there. Therefore the windows version of Atom is worst one and needs this feature the most.

"202","Feature: disable update download on metered connection","
### Description

FEATURE: Disable update download on metered connection, so data plan does not get drained

In Windows users have the ability to mark Connection as 'metered'
this option is to indicate spare use of data connection.

Atom does not ask to download update, therefore it drains the data plan.

This is an improvement for users on mobile connections

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Got to Network & Internet Setting in Windows 10 (Win 8 too)
2. Click WiFi Tab
3. Click Manage Known networks
4. Choose Desired Network SSID
5. Click Properties
6. Scroll down to metered connection
7. Turn metered connection On
8. Start Atom editor (old version)
9. Observe huge (~200MB) data usage whe Atom downloads update.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
Atom should check if connection is metered to not automatically download update

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
Atom downloads data with update

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]
always

### Description

The Dock toggles will sometimes develop a rendering glitch, causing a bar to appear around the button.

### Steps to Reproduce (_Updated_)

1. Install the `docks-test` package found here: [docks-test.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1109683/docks-test.zip)
2. Install `atom-material-ui`. Tested with v2.0.4.
3. Open a file.

**Expected behavior:**

No graphical bugs with the Dock item.

**Actual behavior:**

When the ""flow in"" animation for the Dock toggle finishes a rectangular shaped region of the screen as high as the button but much wider will appear colored in the `@app-background-color` (I think), sometimes it will have content from the status bar showing in the bar. This status bar content is _not_ from the area ""under"" the bar, so it's not something that is getting translated up with the button.

""Normal"" blank bar:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/27649520-e67c8668-5be6-11e7-896d-38285a96c1b9.png)

Status bar content:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/27649153-d0a616a2-5be5-11e7-9b60-f0499731681a.png)

GIF:
![2017-06-28_09-48-51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/27649602-1607e576-5be7-11e7-9487-c512ba257bf7.gif)

Note that with the updated steps to reproduce the behavior is actually worse than shown in the screenshots as the window starts out with a glitched rendering bar:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/27652328-239b7a78-5bf0-11e7-83ac-a714a4f3488f.png)

There is actually a line number hidden behind the bar as well, as can be seen (briefly) in this GIF:
![2017-06-28_10-55-14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/27652371-4b9adafa-5bf0-11e7-9978-912ad8265ab2.gif)


**Reproduces how often:**

Almost all windows seem to eventually show this behavior, but I can't determine a reliable way to reproduce this.

- I can't seem to replicate in safe mode, or with a stock theme (One Dark).
- I use `atom-material-ui` with One Dark Syntax.
- ~~This _might_ be dependent on `linter-ui-default`,~~ but it may just be that that is the only bottom Dock item that I usually have running.
- I only ever see a brief flash of the right side Dock toggle showing this when Atom is loading, once loaded I don't see it from that toggle.

### Versions

 I've seen this since at least v1.18.0 betas, possibly since v1.17.0 betas.

Currently seeing this in:
```
Atom    : 1.19.0-beta2

### Description

Sometimes when updating packages, Atom loses most of its settings. E.g. right now, I updated Hyperclick, and after the restart I was greeted with the welcome message, my font was reset to the default settings, my settings for linter-pycodestyle and linter-pylint were lost, and I assume all the others as well, but I didn't bother with the rest much, so no impact there in my case.

This is difficult to reproduce; I can update packages dozens of times, but every once in a while, it loses all my settings. It's not a disk full issue, as I have 56GB available.

The data loss appears to be limited to the things in ~/.atom/config.cson - the other .cson files and styles.less appear to be unaffected.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Update packages
2. Restart

**Expected behavior:** Atom restarts with upgraded packages, and settings intact.

**Actual behavior:** Atom restarts with upgraded packages, and lost settings.

**Reproduces how often:** Less than 10%

### Description

Hello all!

I just noticed weird behavior of Atom that it does not hide its titlebar when reloading editor in fullscreen mode on `macOS`.

Here are the captured screenshots where in safe mode:

When not in full screen mode:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4936201/27217319-58e116ce-52b4-11e7-9ae8-c8cfe850e02c.png)

When in full screen mode:

When in full screen mode after reloading right after previous step:

### Steps to Reproduce

0. Prepare `macOS` environment. 🤑 
1. Open Atom.
2. Go to `Settings` and change `Title Bar` option to `custom` or `custom-inset` from `Core` setting.
3. Toggle fullscreen by `ctrl` + `cmd` + `f`.
4. Reload editor by `ctrl` + `alt` + `cmd` + `l`.
5. Hang tight until editor titlebar show up

**Expected behavior:** Titlebar hidden when reloading editor.

**Actual behavior:** Titlebar keep showing even in fullscreen mode.

**Reproduces how often:** Every time you follow above steps.

### Description

Let's say I have a git repo with a single file, `a.txt`, on `master`.  The `add-b-file` branch adds a new `b.txt` file to the repo.  When on `add-b-file` with both `a.txt` and `b.txt` open in Atom, switching branches to `master` does not close `b.txt` even if there are no unsaved changes.  I have ""Close Deleted File Tabs"" checked.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a git repo and commit a file
2. Switch to a new branch and add a different file
3. Open both files in Atom
4. Switch back to the original branch

**Expected behavior:** Only `a.txt` to exist in Atom

**Actual behavior:** Both files are still open, with `b.txt` marked as having unsaved changes.

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

Electron: 1.6.9

```

### Additional Information

This looks like a regression from #693.  The steps to reproduce I gave are what I believe to be a simplified version of what I'm experiencing.  If they don't actually work, the actual scenario I'm facing has to do with switching between the `wl-split-grammars` and `master` branch on atom/language-php.

### Description

When creating a new file and hitting Save, the save dialog doesn't seem to have any particular directory set and defaults to a platform-dependent location.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new untitled file
2. Save it

**Expected behavior:**

""Save As"" dialog should default to a sensible location (most likely the project root, which definitely _used_ to be the behaviour)

**Actual behavior:**

**On Ubuntu**, Save dialog opens at ""Recently Used"", sometimes making it a pain to find the logical place to save the file.

**On mac**, seems to default to project root directory, but **only** for the first window opened (I assume it defaults to the process's cwd)

Can't speak for windows right at the moment I'm afraid

Directory is set fine if you're hitting ""save as"" from a file that already exists.

**Reproduces how often:**

Every time

### Versions

Currently 1.18 beta but basically every version since #13978 was reported

### Additional Information

I guess #13978 got closed because the desired behaviour was fixed on mac for the first-opened window and for already-existing files. Looks like this was also reported in #14304 but that was closed because it didn't follow the template.","bug"

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description
Atom doesn't handle .gitignore/exclude files with trailing whitespace. This means that files that are followed by trailing whitespace in .gitignore/exclude always show up as new.

Obviously no one is going to create such files on purpose. I only got bitten by this due to Windows being Windows and adding a trailing whitespace when I innocently did a simple `echo` command. 😛

I checked the git-diff package first and saw that the actual calculation is implemented in Atom using the git-utils npm package, which I think uses libgit2. This might be an issue in libgit2 or it's usage in git-utils or it might be an issue in the way Atom is using git-utils.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Execute in a Windows console (Not Git Bash):
```sh
git init test-repo && cd test-repo
echo. > test.txt && echo. > test2.txt
echo test.txt > .gitignore
echo test2.txt >> .git/info/exclude
```
2. Open `test-repo` in Atom with the default VCS exclude settings.
3. Look at the tree view.

**Expected behavior:** test2.txt doesn't appear in the tree view or in fuzzy finder since it's ignored.

**Actual behavior:** test2.txt appears in the tree view as a new file and also appears in the fuzzy finder. But is ignored by standard Git (`git status`).

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

### Description

It would be nice if the new Dock feature released in `1.17.0` were in its own package so that users can enable and disable as needed. In my own personal use-case, its highly annoying to mouse over to the tree view and have the arrow always animate in and out. Since I don't use docks, I would like to disable. Alternatively, it would be nice if this functionality was behind a setting that I could toggle off. 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Mouse over to tree-view, see arrow appear
2. Mouse out to main editor window, see arrow disappear
3. Repeat.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
I would expect to be able to disable this via disabling an external package, or a setting to disable.

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

Opening a file as a pending pane no longer triggers activation as expected. The end result is that `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor` returns `undefined` until the user interacts with the text editor in some manner (e.g. moving the cursor or making the pane non-pending).

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Launch Atom in any folder that contains some files that can be opened.
2. Click on any file in the tree view (ensure it is opened in a pending pane).
3. Open up the developer tools console.
4. Execute `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()`
5. Notice the method returns `undefined`
6. Click anywhere in the (pending) text editor.
7. Execute `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()`
8. Notice the method returns a `TextEditor` object.

**Expected behavior:** Opening a file in a pending pane should immediately mark the text editor as active.

**Actual behavior:** The text editor in the pending pane is not marked as active until the user directly interacts with the pane/editor.

**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time.

Reproduced it in `--safe` mode. (Didn't have time for the other steps).

### Description

Cursors are misplaced after selecting multiple lines for the first time and typing in grave accents (`). As far as I can tell it is just a visual bug as the next characters are placed correctly behind the accents.

![foo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11627131/26406077/87e5e334-4097-11e7-9350-b284fac8a459.gif)

As you can see in the gif, the cursors are placed correctly after the initial faulty placement.

### Steps to Reproduce

See the gif above. Reproducible each time.

*Edited by @rsese, updated steps:*

1. Open new Window
2. Enter the following lines
```
foo
bar
baz
```
(Don't move the cursor after you are done. It should be right behind baz)

3. Selection -> Add selection above
4. Selection -> Add selection above

You should now have all three lines selected (IMPORTANT: Don't move the cursor. The bug only happens if you add the grave accents right after the ""Add selection above"" action)

### Description

If you attempt to open a directory using a path with spaces in it, and include the trailing `\`, Atom opens to the parent directory with an empty ""file"" of the directory name with a `""` on the end.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Have a directory with a directory that has spaces in the name as one of it's parent folders.
    * For example: `C:\foo bar\foo`
2. From the CLI (`cmd.exe` or PowerShell) attempt to open the folder with a trailing slash in the command.
    * For example: `atom 'C:\Temp\foo bar\foo\'`
3. Note that Atom has opened the _parent_ folder, with the desired folder name open as a ""file"" with an `""` on the end.
    * For example: Atom open to `C:\foo bar` with an empty ""file"" of `foo""` open.

**Expected behavior:**

Atom opens the desired folder, regardless of whether there was a trailing `\` on the path.

**Actual behavior:**

Atom opens the _parent_ folder, with an empty file named after the desired folder with a `""` on the end open.

### Description

When dock was hidden, it **force** focus on workspaceCenter's active pane( Ignore original focus ).

https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14143/commits/73f04fdaed30b774d1f5134a1df05eba30202aab

So hiding dock means ""focus is taken away from originally focused element"".
I want hiding dock not cause focus change unless hidden dock was originally focused.

When package-author try to implement action which hide dock and want to keep focus on `select-list` or mini-editor.
It's unnecessarily difficult since hiding dock force focus to workspaceCenter's active pane.

- Actual situation

In my [project-folder](https://atom.io/packages/project-folder) package, user can add/remove multiple project with keeping focus on select-list.
The `space` key in `select-list` is keymapped as ""confirm and continue"" action which confirm current item on select-list and keep focus on `select-list` so that user can continuously remove/add project folder.
From atom v1.17(which introduced dock), when project paths get emptied, tree-view destroy itself and tree-view's dock is hidden.
At this point, **focus is taken away from select-list to workspaceCenter's active pane** and `blur` event is fired on `select-list`'s element. which cause `cancel()` of select-list.
I don't want `cancel`, or `blur`, just want focus kept on originally focused `selec-list`'s mini-editor.

This is new issue from atom v1.17.0. Was not problem in v1.16.0.

https://github.com/t9md/atom-project-folder/issues/9#issuecomment-298679687

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Set following commands and keymap.

- `init.coffee`

```coffeescript
atom.commands.add 'atom-workspace',
  'user:focus-taken-away-repro': ->
    for dir in atom.project.getPaths()
      atom.project.removePath(dir)
```

- `keymap.cson`

```coffeescript
'.select-list':
  'space': 'user:focus-taken-away-repro'
```

2. Start atom-beta(v1.17) with at least one project-folder listed on tree-view.
3. `cmd-t` to start `fuzzy-finder`.
4. type `space`, which invoke `user:focus-taken-away-repro` comands.

- In atom 1.16.0: focus remain in `select-list`'s mini-editor.
- In atom 1.17.0-beta3: focus taken away from `select-list` to activePane.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

Want atom not take away original focus when dock was hidden.
Want keep focused on `select-list`'s mini-editor.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

Original focus was taken away from `select-list` to activePane.

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]

100%, allways.

### Description
Hey Atomizers! I wanted to kick a little feature request your way, if it's not too much trouble. I've noticed that in the beta build of Atom, reopening a project in a window with a preexisting tab gives one the option to discard Atom's autosaved project state. I was wondering if it wouldn't be more consistent with the ""Restore Previous Windows on Start"" setting if, when ""restore windows"" was flagged `false`, opening any project---from the menu, via drag-and-drop, from the CLI, from a project management package---automatically dropped its state on the floor.

I'm ultimately trying to get back to a world like the one I enjoyed when setting `hot_exit` to `false` in Sublime Text, wherein projects never remember expanded directories or opened tabs. (Unsaved buffers are another story: losing those was a part of the deal with Sublime, but Atom's behavior could in theory be gentler there.) Nineish times out of ten, rather than dropping me helpfully where I was working six minutes ago, the state restoration drops me annoyingly where I was working six weeks ago; it's easier just to get back to where I was on my own.

The behavior is _so close_ to what I'm looking for in `1.17.0-beta3`, _except_ that reopening a project in a clean window always restores its tabs (which focus themselves in the Tree View as I close them, ack):

![screenflow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2207980/25434235/84b25d5e-2a59-11e7-9d2e-4a45d685fadc.gif)

Can't imagine this being super-high-priority by any stretch, but I also don't quite have the Atom-fu to tackle it on my own. Would be grateful if someone looking for an easy PR would consider it. :pray:

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open a whole mess'a tabs in an Atom project window.
2. Close the project without explicitly closing your tabs.
3. Open a new window and reopen that selfsame project.
4. Tabs. Why did it have to be tabs.

**Suggested behavior:** When ""Restore Previous Windows on Start"" is disabled, Atom should discard all preexisting project state---including opened tabs.

**Actual behavior:** Atom selectively remembers some preexisting project state regardless of the setting---including opened tabs.

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

### Description

There is no chance to distinguish a normal line from a part of a soft-wrapped line.
Additionally I want to distinguish the first line and the last line from the other wrapped parts.

I see these possibilities:
* class `.line` could be the whole line including all continuation lines and the wrapped partial lines have a different class (something like `.wrapped-line`)
```
<div class=""line"">
  <div class=""wrapped-line first-wrapped-line"">line beginning</div>
  <div class=""wrapped-line"">line continuation</div>
  <div class=""wrapped-line last-wrapped-line"">line continuation</div>
</div>
```
* if this breaks too much, it could be the other way:
the wrapped parts could be wrapped by a class `.soft-wrapped-line`
```
<div class=""soft-wrapped-line"">
  <div class=""line first-wrapped-line"">line beginning</div>
  <div class=""line continuation-line"">line continuation</div>
  <div class=""line last-wrapped-line"">line end</div>
</div>
```
* if this still breaks too much, it could be without the outer level:
```
<div class=""line first-wrapped-line"">line beginning</div>
<div class=""line continuation-line"">line continuation</div>
<div class=""line last-wrapped-line"">line end</div>
```

This would allow to make display of continuation lines more usable.
E.g. currently you see indent markers etc. which is wrong IMHO while visible whitespace seems to be correct.

I would add wrapping markers in front of continuation lines and also at the end of a line being wrapped. These are the points where you look while reading. Currently you have to look in the gutter instead which is not convenient.

Here is an example (SciTE-Editor):

### Description

The split-pane layout management feature doesn't work when dragging tabs to a new window.

In fact, dropping a tab anywhere outside the tab bar just gets ignored.  This is surprising because that's not how dragging works in the main window.

This is related to this excellent PR: https://github.com/atom/tabs/pull/252

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a project
2. Create a new window with `cmd-shift-N`
3. Drag a tab from the project to the window you just opened

**Expected behavior:** Ideally, you'd see the shaded regions allowing you to open a new pane left/right/top...  But I'd settle for a drop in the content area working.

"245","Update application.json only on change","### Description

File .atom/storage/application.json is updated with every window context switch. But as there is no change at all in 99% of cases, the only thing that is really changed is modification timestamp of the file.
This is not nice, as it constantly writes to disk when you are switching between application widows.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Atom and some file in it
2. Switch focus to another program window (even another Atom window)
3. Switch back
4. Switch focus to another program window (even another Atom window)
5. .atom/storage/application.json gets updated (just new timestamp) even though the list of opened ""initialPaths"" stays the same

**Expected behavior:** 
File application.json should be updated only when there is a change to it's content or when Atom is closing.

**Actual behavior:** 
File application.json gets updated at every focus switch even though there is no change of it's content.

### Description

File handle conflict detecting file renames, when saving and renaming files at the same time.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. <del>Open a file named `fft.cpp`.</del>
2. <del>Create another empty file, enter something in it, and open the ""Save File"" dialog, but do not save the file at the moment.</del>
3. <del>Rename the file `fft.cpp` into `fft2.cpp`.</del>
4. <del>Save the newly opened file to the same folder, and call it `fft.cpp`. This wouldn't cause any conflict, as they are mutually different files.</del>
5. <del>**At this point, you may notice, both open tabs turn into `fft2.cpp`.</del>
6. <del>**If you save any of the two files, the other would change its content into this one, rendering the previously available content unreachable.**</del>

As I was alleged of not stating the stati clearly enough, this is a modified version of the reproduction steps.

1. Create a file / open a file **in Atom** whose location is `D:/a.cpp`.
2. **In Atom**, create another file and add arbitrary things in it, then open the `Save File` dialog. **DO NOT INTERACT WITH ATOM AT THE MOMENT.**
3. **IN EXPLORER OR CMD, WHERE YOU WOULD NOT INTERACT WITH ATOM**, rename `D:/a.cpp` to `D:/b.cpp`.
4. **In the Save File dialog**, there should only be a file `b.cpp` on Drive D.
5. **In the Save File dialog**, save the new (empty) file as `D:/a.cpp`.
6. **Currently in Atom**, both open tabs should appear as `b.cpp - D:/`.
7. **IN ATOM**, saving any of the two files would result in the other having its contents change into this one.

**Expected behavior:** The first file should turn its name to `b.cpp`, while the newly saved file should retain its expected name `a.cpp`.

**Actual behavior:** Both files turn into `b.cpp`, and are duplicates of the same *file handle*.

**Reproduces how often:** **This can be reproduced at a rate of 100%, regardless of the file names.**

### Versions

**Affects Atom versions `1.8.x` through `1.16.0`, as far as I am concerned.**

Operating system: Windows 10.0.14393.

### Additional Information

I've never read any of the related code, and decided that there's something to do with the file system journal. Probably this requires a big fix.

**To regulators:** Change the issue title if you consider it inappropriate.

### Description
onDidReload getting fired before onDidChange

### Steps to Reproduce
Was able to get a isolated repro with @Arcanemagus help.

1. `git clone https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint.git`
2. `git checkout arcanemagus/atom-repro-case`
3. run `atom .` from the repo cloned in step 1.
4. run package specs(test will always pass)
5.  open devtools in the spec window


**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]
onDidReload gets fired after onDidChange.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]
`onDidReload` sometimes gets fired before `onDidChange`,  This causes issues as `onDidReload` is being fired when the editor is blank.  

**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]
~75%


### Versions

You can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.

### Description

When opening files (eg from the Tree View, which is where I experienced this), it is possible to open the same file multiple times.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Rapidly double-click on the same file in the Tree View

**Expected behavior:** The file to open once, become permanent (if applicable), and further double-clicks on the file to refocus the editor.

**Actual behavior:** The file opens multiple times.

**Reproduces how often:** Almost 100%.  @nathansobo mentioned that it's more likely to occur the faster you click, probably because of the new async methods.

### Description

There are already lots of unsaved buffer loss related issues, mostly of files with no project folder. However, this data loss scenario can also happen to a file with a project folder, without unusual or unintended behaviors such as crashing Atom, opening multiple windows of Atom, etc. It can be reproduced by the following steps.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Atom with project folder A and make some change. Be sure that the changes are not saved.
2. Close Atom.
3. Open Atom with project folder B.
4. Add project folder A, and then remove project folder B.
5. Close Atom.
6. Open Atom with project folder A. (Or possibly with no project folder)
7. Now the changes are gone!

**Expected behavior:** The changes must be preserved at a certain step. If Atom handles unsaved buffers separate from project folders, the changes should be shown in step 3. This was what I expected (as Sublime Text does) before I search for the related issues and find out that Atom integrates the editor's state with project folders. Since Atom integrates them, the changes in step 1 may be expected reappear in either step 4 (when adding project folder A) or step 6.

**Actual behavior:** Data loss

**Reproduces how often:** Always

### Description

`atom.showSaveDialogSync('some/chosen/path/to/file')` used to work (still worked in version 1.14.0) but doesn't work in version 1.15.0.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Atom in debug mode
2. Open console panel
3. Create a new file and edit something in the editor
4. In the console panel, type `atom.showSaveDialogSync('some/chosen/path/filename')`

**Expected behavior:** A save dialog pops out with the filename and path pre-set according to the param. 

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens] The save dialog doesn't set to designated path and filename.

**Reproduces how often:** Always in version 1.15.0.

### Description

When I copy a line without selecting any part of it, whether using Ctrl-c or right clicking and choosing ""Copy"", and then try to paste the contents of the line, they get added to the beginning of the line instead of being put where my cursor is.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a file in Atom. It doesn't matter if there are other lines in this file or not.
2. Move your cursor to the very last line of the file. Type some text there. Press Ctrl-c.
3. Place your cursor on any line in the file, at any place in the line, and press Ctrl-v.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

I would expect the copied text to be pasted where the cursor is, without any newlines being pasted.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

Instead, the copied text is added to the beginning of the line and, if the cursor is not on the last line of the file, it moves down a line.

Here's a simple example, where I copy `a`, type `b`, then paste repeatedly:

A regression from #13825 is causing _all_ forward slashes in spec output to be converted to Windows-style.  For example:

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a test that will have forward slashes in its output if it fails
2. Run that spec in the Spec Reporter on Windows and make sure it fails

"276",".gitignore file not adjusting the visual aid off the Tree View","Similar to https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3429#issuecomment-286594653

### Description

I have downloaded atom. Installed it. Opened up a project and the `.gitignore` is not being detected and the Tree View is not changing (reducing the opacity of the folder).

It used to do this in the past. I have tried several projects and all do not work. These projects all work in other applications/IDE so I do not believe it's a project issue. I feel like I'm doing something really silly..

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Have a fresh install of Atom with no setting changes
2. Set `tree-view.hideVcsIgnoredFiles` to `true`
3. Create a new directory `~/test`
3. Change to the `~/test` directory
3. Execute `git init` within `~/test`
3. Open Atom with the command `atom ~/test`
3. Create a folder named `should-be-ignored`
4. Create a `.gitignore` file
4. Add a line containing `should-be-ignored` to the `.gitignore` file

**Expected:** Folder named `should-be-ignored` to disappear

**Actual:** Folder named `should-be-ignored` remains and does not change color

### Original Repro Steps

1. Have a fresh install of Atom with no setting changes
2. Enable the VCS settings
3. Create a folder, name it eg: `should-be-ignored`
4. Create a .gitignore, add that folder to it
5. Nothing changes

**Expected behavior:** I expect it to tint/opacity change the folder in the Tree view so it's visibly different.

**Actual behavior:** Nothing happens, no visual que.

### Versions

- Windows 10, 64bit
- Downloaded Latest atom from https://atom.io/
    - Atom 1.15.0
    - Atom Beta 1.16.0 also doesn't work

No plugins.

### Description

`atom.workspace.open` takes a parameter called `activateItem`, described as:

> A Boolean indicating whether to call `Pane::activateItem` on containing pane. Defaults to `true`.

While accurate, `Pane::activateItem` is responsible for calling `Pane::add`. Thus, if `activateItem` is false, the opened item does not get added to the pane at all.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `atom.workspace.open('file.txt', {activateItem: false})` in the Atom JS console

### Description

Feature request:

I have a symlink in my source directory ""main.c"", which is a link to ""main.c.variant1"" (or perhaps one of the other variants). Atom nicely follows the link, but the fact that the destination file isn't "".c"" causes it to not do any syntax highlighting or other language-specific stuff.

It would be nice if it made that decision based on the name of the symlink, or perhaps only when the destintation file is of unknown type, or perhaps with an option setting.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Find, say, ""sample.c"" in your source directory.
2. Rename it ""sample.c.notype"".
3. Create a symbolic link ""sample.c"" to point to it.
4. Open ""sample.c"" in Atom.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

It should be able to figure out that it's a C program.

It doesn't.

### Description

Added project folder in tree view would _disappear_ after dispatching command `window:reload` in current beta `1.15-beta-4`;
however, in current stable version `1.14.4` it _shows_ in tree view.

__NOTE__: 
  - this issue happens in both `tree-view`: `0.213.1` and `0.214.1` which are versions along with Atom `1.14.4` and `1.15-beta-4` respectively.
  - if doing `atom.restartApplication()` rather than `window:reload` then added project folder would show.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. `$ atom-beta` in terminal to launch Atom beta
2. atom shows some project folders in tree view from last session
3. add a new project folder to tree view
4. `ctrl-shift-f5` to reload atom

**Expected behavior:**

added new project folder would appear in tree view

**Actual behavior:**

added new project folder disappears in tree view, tree view remains same as in step no.2.

@ebluestein found this while working on a feature for Nuclide. It's occurring because the item's being searched for synchronously but then added asynchronously. To solve it, we probably have to introduce a queue so that the second call doesn't happen until the first completes. (This can be as simple as storing a promise per-URI while the `open()` is in progress and chaining to that.)

"286","Window close does not trigger save window state","### Description

Closing the Atom window does not save the window UI state, _read_ window size and position. To save the window state I have to **blur** (click outside) the window, then close it. Reopening the window after blurring it works.

According to the code in `window-event-handler.coffee` the window state should be stored both when a window closes and when blurred:
```coffee
handleWindowBlur: =>
    @atomEnvironment.storeWindowDimensions()

handleWindowBeforeunload: (event) =>
  @atomEnvironment.storeWindowDimensions()
```

### Steps to Reproduce

1. `atom .` to open project of your choice
2. Resize window, maintain window focus
3. Close window
4. Back to terminal, `atom .` again

Redo step **1-2** and before closing the window in step **3**, **blur** the window, click your desktop. Then close the window and continue with step **4**, the new window should open with the same dimensions as the window you just closed.

**Expected behavior:** The window you open in step **4** should be restored to the resized state, when you closed the window.

**Actual behavior:** The window you open in step **4** is restored back to the state before you resized, in step **2**.

"287","Improper display of long indented hyperlinks in text files with soft wrap","### Prerequisites

* [X] All done! Including ""safe mode"" and ""factory settings"".

### Additional information:

This issue was originally opened here: https://github.com/atom/language-hyperlink/issues/16. But as commented by @lee-dohm this may not be ""a flaw in the language-hyperlink package itself and more of a problem with rendering"". @AndreaGriffiths11

### Description:

Long indented hyperlinks produce these ugly ugly lines when soft wrap is enabled in atom:

![atom_lorem_link_circled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19208670/23333215/175be1b2-fb88-11e6-8d6f-cb271c7ed9c8.png)

How do I get rid of these lines? The blank spaces should not be underlined since they're not part of the hyperlink.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Optional: Reset to factory defaults with `mv ~/.atom ~/.atom-backup` under linux.
2. Copy-paste a long hyperlink in a .txt file.
3. Indent it with a few tabs.
4. Enable Soft Wrap with: `View > Toggle Soft Wrap.`
5. And disable the Indent Guide if it's activated: `Settings > Editor > Show Indent Guide`

I get the ugly lines 100% of the time on two different computers.

### Configuration:

`atom --version`:
Atom: 1.14.3
Electron: 1.3.13
Chrome: 52.0.2743.82
Node: 6.5.0
`apm --version`:
apm  1.15.3

"288","Atom closes without prompting to save","Hello,
I am using Atom 1.14.3 in Mint-17 64-bit and the following scenario causes Atom to close without prompting to save the modified file.

Core setting is:
""Restore previous windows on start"" -- UNCHECKED
""Open Empty editor on start"" -- CHECKED

Scenario 1 - With just one Untitled tab (as expected)
1) Launch Atom editor from Menu
2) In the Untitled tab (document), type something to make it into a modified but DO NOT save the document
3) Close Atom and it will prompt you to save or to discard the Untitled document.

Scenario 2 - With one Untitled document + One unmodified file (The bug scenario)
1) Launch Atom editor from Menu
2) Open a document but do not modify it
3) If TreeView is shown, toggle it off
4) In the Untitled document, type something to modify it but do not save it. It does not matter how many ""Untitled"" documents are opened. 
5) Press Ctrl-Q or hit the X to close Atom. Atom does not prompt the user to save the Untitled document and simply discarding it and exit. OOPS! This is difference from Scenario 1.

I have been using an unmodified version of Atom other than to choose the themes from standard ones.

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description

By default, Atom uses a base64 encoded image as the text cursor in the atom-text-editor component. There are some problems with this:

- It's not the native text cursror - looks out of place
- It doesn't scale well - the first image below is the default cursor, with macOS cursor scaling enabled. The second shows the native OS text cursor (pixellated..). The native cursror was scaled correctly as a vector but the screenshot tool for some reason renders it at the normal 1x size (just imagine it scaled properly :))

![cursor-img](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4211302/23124134/4f4b3998-f763-11e6-9534-90431208c23e.png)

Fix is to use something similar to this: 

```css
atom-text-editor.editor .scroll-view {
    cursor: text;
}
```

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Hover over a text field

**Expected behavior:** Cursor should be native text cursor, should scale with accessibility settings

**Actual behavior:** Cursor is a custom raster image - therefore becomes pixellated when scaled

**Reproduces how often:** 100%

### Description

If soft wrap is enabled on a new, unsaved file and you save that file, then soft wrap is disabled on that file.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a new, untitled window.
2. Put in enough text so as to require horizontal scrolling, and enable the soft wrapping under ""View"" -> ""Toggle Soft Wrap""
3. Save the file

**Expected behavior:**

I expect the file to save and retain the soft wrap settings.

**Actual behavior:** 

The file saves but soft wrap is reset, and you get a single long line of text.

**Reproduces how often:**

100% reproducible. Only happens when saving a *new* file - if you enable soft wrap again, make some changes in the file and save it again, then the soft wrap settings are retained.

### Description

When I open an specific file (described below) with an specific windows size (see screencap) atom will try to accommodate the text by wrapping the long lines, then revert it and try again,resulting in the text alternating between this too states in a loop. The bottom half of the text will show and disappear while the top is being rearranged.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open this file on atom https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/blob/d8e5577dcc7096d2b694dda433e2b5c7c4561a82/README.md
2. If the text is still, resize the window until it reproduces the bug.

**Expected behavior:** 
The text should be rendered and stay still until the window is resized.

**Actual behavior:** 
The text will ""blink"" between these three states.

### Description

I'm currently grappling with a problem with my laptop where it restarts when resuming from sleep without an external power source.  This causes Atom to lose the project I was working on, and I have to reopen it.  The Reopen Projects menu is also empty, though it is populated once a folder is opened.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a folder in Atom
2. Somehow trigger an unexpected restart (I don't know if holding down the power button will work for this)
3. After restarting, reopen Atom

**Expected behavior:** The project to be displayed

**Actual behavior:** An empty editor with only an Untitled tab (if that option is enabled)

    * [x] Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description
Open a new file from terminal from same project, clears old tabs and unsaved buffer from that project

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open a project in terminal with `atom .`
2. Open a file and modify it, don't save.
3. Close Atom(this won't repro if there's other atom windows open.  Only if all Atom instances are closed)
4. On the same directory in terminal, do `atom <new file name>`


**Actual**: Atom opens new file with the current folder.  The changes on the file that was modify in step 2 are gone.  When you close Atom and reopen with `atom .` or opening recent projects, it shows the new file from step 4 only.

**Expected**: old tabs and unsaved changes should exist(if there are any) and new file should open in new tab 

**Reproduces how often:** 100% if you don't have another atom instance open, If you do, the new file will be opened there.

### Description

I have created a new package [toggle-mode-modules](https://atom.io/packages/toggle-node-modules) and tried to use the following as a default keymap, but it does NOT appear when selecting `Packages -> Toggle Node Modules -> Toggle`

I have since changed the default to `ctrl-shift-t` which now works...

```
'.platform-linux atom-workspace, .platform-win32 atom-workspace':
  'shift-ctrl-t': 'toggle-node-modules:toggle'

'.platform-darwin atom-workspace':
  'shift-ctrl-t': 'toggle-node-modules:toggle'
``` 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. This can be replicated by trying to create a new entry in `keymap.cson`

```
'.platform-darwin atom-workspace':
  'shift-ctrl-t': **'toggle-node-modules:toggle'
```

**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]

I expected the defined keymap to appear in `Packages -> Toggle Node Modules -> Toggle`

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]

No menu keyboard equivalent appears

"301","1.13 Regression: Font Family setting causing CssSyntaxErrors","### Prerequisites

Note: I am only able to reproduce some of the issues.

### Description

Starting with the release of Atom 1.13.0, we have received [a](https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-wont-start-up/38354) [number](https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-1-13-update-non-functional/38189/10) [of](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13586) [bug](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/900) [reports](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13631) about the Font Family setting causing a `CssSyntaxError` to be thrown.  These errors did not appear in versions prior to 1.13.0, and while they may be correct, should at the very least be displayed in a more ""pleasing"" manner.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Enter a quote or some otherwise malformed CSS into the Font Family box.  Some reports also suggest that a semicolon can cause the error, but I couldn't reproduce it.

**Expected behavior:** Nothing

**Actual behavior:** CssSyntaxError

**Reproduces how often:** 100% for quotes or otherwise invalid CSS, 0% for semicolons

### Versions

You can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.

Not relevant, this is a 1.13 regression.  Appears to happen on all OSes.

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

### Description
When using linters with auto-fix enabled (for example linter-eslint), it will fix code style errors for you upon saving the file you're working on, e.g. missing semi colon, incorrect indentation, etc.

For a while now, when this happens, Atom tends to momentarily blank out the window and then re-insert the fixed contents, causing the window to scroll up. This is problematic, as it causes you to lose your scroll position and as such your focus of the area of code you were working on.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install/enable only core packages and linter as well as linter-eslint
2. Use the following rules for eslint:

```
{
    ""parser"": ""babel-eslint"",
    ""env"": {
        ""es6"": true
    },
    ""rules"": {
        ""semi"": [ 1, ""always"" ]
    }
}
```

3. Open these file contents (thanks @dwelle) http://pastebin.com/raw/Yk6K1w5k and save as `test.js`.
4. Scroll to the bottom and remove the last semi colon.
5. Save the file

**Expected behavior:**
Contents remains visible, then is fixed/replaced by a fixed contents, while maintaining scroll position.

**Actual behavior:**
The buffer is cleared, then contents re-appears and the scroll position is at the top.

**Reproduces how often:**
Nearly 100% with the provided example file.

npm  3.10.5
node 4.4.5 x64
python 2.7.10
git 2.6.2

### Additional information
Note that while the example file is quite large with 3000+ lines, this behaviour *does* occur quite regularly with smaller files as well. It's just not 100% reproducible in those cases. But it could be that the file size/length emphasises the issue.

"303","Adopt Sublime Text's handling of punctuation at the start of alt-left/right","### Description

Atom alt-left/right and alt-shift-left/right (skip over or select word) should ignore certain punctuation characters in front of the cursor. This makes it easier to select parts of a JavaScript property chain, for example.

### Steps to Reproduce

Tab through this text in Atom vs. Sublime Text:

    this.props.horse.cart.battery.staple

Tab through this text in Atom vs. Sublime Text:

    this.props.horse.cart['battery'][staple]

Screencast showing Sublime Text vs. Atom behaviour:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qovtU8MIygo&feature=youtu.be

**Expected behavior:**

In the first example when you start a selection before a period Sublime Text includes the period and continues to the next punctuation character. In the second example Sublime Text also skips over `['` at the beginning of the selection.

**Actual behavior:**

Atom stops at every punctuation character.

    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages

The problem cannot be reproduced in safe mode, as safe mode does not load packages and themes. I recognise that the problem is caused by a package external to Atom. I believe that this is a valid issue despite this. I have met the other prerequisites.

### Description

When a UI theme is selected with a `styles/ui-variables.less` file which would cause the Less compiler to error, and Atom is reloaded, the editor fails to load, and the window remains an empty white box.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone [atom-community/ui-theme-template](https://github.com/atom-community/ui-theme-template).
2. Append `#` on a new line to `styles/ui-variables.less`. Alternatively, `@foo: @bar;` can be appended, where `@bar` is undefined. This also reproduces the issue. 
3. Run `apm link --dev` in the root of the repository.
4. Open Atom in developer mode (`atom --dev`), navigate to the themes section of the settings screen, and select ""Ui Theme Template"" from the UI themes dropdown list.
5. Reload Atom in developer mode (I tried both `ctrl + alt + r`, and simply closing Atom and re-opening it with `atom --dev`).

I have only reproduced the problem in developer mode. I have not attempted to reproduce the problem in Atom's normal mode, as I fear being unable to reverse it.

**Expected behavior:** The editor loads.

**Actual behavior:** The editor does not load, and the window remains an empty white box. The Chromium developer tools automatically open to the console.

**Reproduces how often:** Every time.

### Description

`Cursor::getPixelRect` calls deprecated `TextEditor::pixelRectForScreenRange`. Causing a deprecation warning in latest Atom Beta 1.13.0-beta9.

`This is now a view method. Call TextEditorElement::pixelRectForScreenRange instead.`

### Steps to Reproduce

Use the color-picker plugin on latest beta, check deprecation warnings.  Throws this call stack in the warning:

```
TextEditor.pixelRectForScreenRange - /Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/text-editor.js:3559:12
Cursor.getPixelRect - /Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/cursor.js:675:26

It seems like you've patched one problem, only to expose yet another with the release of Atom 1.12.8. As while you may have fixed a CentOS dependency issue there's a new Fedora dependency issue. Trying to install Atom 1.12.8 with Fedora's DNF package manager (namely on Fedora 25) gave the error:

2. Copy from (and including) the new-line at the end of the first line, upto the end of the second line. Go to the end of the third line, and paste.

**Expected behavior:** The result should be:
```
a
  b
    c

We render a scrollbar by creating a div with a height that reflects the editor's screen line count. Unfortunately DOM nodes' heights seem to be bounded:

#### Decoration rendering

Absolutely-positioned elements like cursors stop rendering correctly after a certain number of lines. It seems that DOM nodes' `top` property has a hard upper bound.

(Some pre-reqs have been omitted because they don't apply)

### Description

Paraphrasing from my comment over at https://github.com/atom/bracket-matcher/pull/249#issuecomment-264072613...

There's no way to respect the user's setting when overriding `nonWordCharacters` in a scope-specific setting since `nonWordCharacters` is a single string.  That means it's an all-or-nothing change, rather than being able to add or remove characters as necessary.

For example, $ is a valid identifier for many languages. However the default `nonWordCharacters` includes `$`, which means attempting to double-click to select a variable with `$` in it will only select part of it. The best way to fix this currently is to override `nonWordCharacters` in the language settings by copying/pasting the default value and removing the `$`. However, this totally disregards any customizations the user may have made.

**Possible solutions**:
* The best one I could think of is adding some type of new setting that takes scenarios like these into account.

### Steps to Reproduce

"321","Grapheme clusters are not properly supported","**EDIT: The emoji is now rendered properly but does not behave properly.  See https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13360#issuecomment-272671671.**

I'm running Atom 1.12.6 on macOS Sierra 10.12.1. While many single-codepoint emoji like 👻 are properly supported, emojis consisting of multiple codepoints (connected via [zero-width joiners](http://emojipedia.org/zero-width-joiner/)) like 👩?👩?👦?👦 are not.

Pasting the first into Atom:

It seems the joiners are removed, and the individual codepoints are inserted as separate characters. You can reproduce this by simply copy-pasting the emojis from this issue, or using the emoji selector (Ctrl + Command + Space) on a Mac.

### Description

When editing a mixed-language document (German and Syriac, which is an RTL language), the behaviour at the junctions of these languages as well as inside of Syriac text is erratic at best. I noticed four distinct problematic behaviours:

- it takes around three dozen presses of the left or right arrow keys to step into a half-dozen-letter Syriac word, through it, and back out of it again
- it is almost impossible to place the cursor at the intended Syriac letter using the mouse
- once you click into a Syriac word, the cursor disappears
- (this one is minor) Syriac letters don't obey the letter width of fixed-width fonts such as Courier New

Taken together, these issues are unfortunately a deal-breaker for me. I also have to edit documents combining other RTL and LTR languages and it is day-to-day work for me. This is unfortunate, because I really like that Atom always keeps the document left-aligned instead of deciding alignment line-by-line as e.g. gedit does.

I suspect a connection of what I'm experiencing here to what is described in #4682.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. open atom
2. paste below text into the editing area
3. position cursor before the first letter
4. keep right arrow key pressed; notice time it takes the cursor to move through non-Latin parts of the document
5. try other things described above

"325","change the atom.sh script to launch the local build","The `atom.sh` script (which gets copied to the `out`directory during the build process) [seems to be looking](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/0122b7726a1e4eace2a9650b94d9e03c2926c944/atom.sh#L66-L82) in common system-wide locations for an installed Atom version before looking for a local binary, which makes it impossible to use the script to run the locally built atom from the `out` directory.

[According to](https://atomio.slack.com/archives/atom/p1479831997006512) @50Wliu, the batch file on Windows is set up differently and always runs the relative Atom binary. It would be nice if the atom.sh script did the same.","enhancement"
"326","Atom silently dismisses some serious (though non-critical) startup errors","I had configured (via /etc/environment) the TMP var (which specifies the temporary directory on most GNU/Linux) to point to ~/.tmp, but as I already know, node-based apps don't recognize it (though other apps, like Thunderbird, do).

This dir is where node-based apps store a temporary unix socket for IPC. What I see as a problem (I understand this is not a bug, but a implementation decision, though IMO it would be better to change it) is that when Atom is not able to create an IPC socket (or on any other significant, though not critical error), it silently ignores the error and continues as if everything was OK. Then we observe a degradation in user experience without understanding the real cause. In my case it was that Atom was not detecting correctly that there was already a running instance so it was creating a new window for each new file opened externally (via shell/cli). Though, it does create an error file ~/.atom/nohup.out with the following content:

```

"328","In some scenarios, opening Atom on Linux results in 100% CPU usage of a core","* When some Linux users open Atom via .desktop files or via the gnome launcher, they experience 100% CPU usage due to the way we are invoking the shell to patch the user's environment
* This does not happen for all Linux users
* This does seem to happen consistently for users on Arch Linux
* The shell is invoked with `detached: false` and using the `-i` flag for an interactive shell
  * The intent of shelling out to get the environment is to run the same shell initialization scripts that are run when a user opens a terminal window and invokes atom from there
  * Removing the `-i` flag is not the solution, because it doesn't result in the desired behavior; it does result in the shell exiting as expected without consuming 100% of a CPU core
  * Adding `detached: true` to the options used for `child_process.spawn` _does_ fix the issue and retains the desired behavior, but it requires additional code to manage the process lifecycle if Atom exits or an Atom window is reloaded while the shell process is still running

The below is a copy of https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13084#issuecomment-262507036, included here to open up a new issue:

@phw says:

~~~
I debugged this a bit and can reproduce it with the following test script (extracted from [src/update-process-env.js](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/1b2d2f029945c58cf4cd474ef1423856b35cf26c/src/update-process-env.js)):

```javascript
const childProcess = require('child_process')
const cmd = 'command env'
const shell = process.env.SHELL  // zsh or bash doesn't matter, behavior is the same
// const shell = '/bin/bash'

const child = childProcess.spawn(shell, ['-ilc', cmd], {
   encoding: 'utf8',
  //  detached: true,
  stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', process.stderr]
})
child.on('error', (e) => {
  console.log('error', e)
})
child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(data.toString('utf8'))
})
child.on('close', (code, signal) => {
  console.log('close', code, signal)
})
```

Launching this directly from a shell works, even if I set an empty environment like so:

    env -i SHELL=/bin/bash node spawn.js

Launching the same from a desktop file in Gnome 3.22 leads to the shell task endlessly consuming 100% of CPU. I used the following desktop file:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Spawn Node Test
Exec=env SHELL=/bin/bash node /home/phw/devel/spawn.js
Icon=atom
Type=Application
```

Two things help to solve this issue:

a) Enable `detached: true` when spawning the child process
b) Remove the `-i` flag from the shell call

I think b) would actually be correct anyway, since this is in no way an interactive shell.

EDIT: Just to be clear: I still don't know exactly *why*  this is happening, I just know the issue can be circumvented removing the `-i` flag.","bug"

### Description

- When I open a large file and move the cursor to the bottom, and then click View->Panes->Split Right.
I found the scroll bar position of previous pane rewind to the top but the cursor is still on the last line.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Start Atom using `atom --safe` from `cmd.exe`
2. Open any file and resize the Atom window so you have a vertical scrollbar visible
3. Scroll to the middle of an opened file
4. Run `pane:split-right-and-copy-active-item`
5. Expected: The scrollbars to stay in the same position for both files. Actual: The scrollbars in both files moves to the top of the file
6. Close the right pane
7. Expected: The scrollbar position of the first file to not change. Actual: The scrollbar in the first file is displayed at the top of the file.

### Description

The first dead key used in the editor will ignore its first keystroke.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use a fresh install of Atom
2. Set Windows' keyboard mode to United States-International (preferably while using a keyboard with the same layout)
3. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> to get a new file.
4. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>""</kbd> then <kbd>Space</kbd>

**Expected behavior:**

A double quotation mark character `""` should be inserted.

**Actual behavior:**

A space character ` ` was inserted. When repeating step 4 after this a double quotation mark character is inserted as expected. This issue will not occur again in the same window unless it is reloaded or Atom is restarted.

"334","Code folds are not restored after closing Atom","I am finding that after closing Atom and re-opening my session and tabs are restored by code folds are not.

I am writing a lot of functions and I do not need to see all of my code all the time so I depend on code folding to make things manageable.

Code folding does not make things easier for me if I have to go through and re-close every function each time I open Atom before I can begin.

Should folds be remembered? I can't see any mention of this in the documentation so I am not sure if it is a bug or a missing feature.

I am aware of the remember-folds package but this only saves folds when opening and closing tabs - not closing and restoring Atom.","bug"
"335","Package settings Keybindings disappear after unchecking Enable box","### Description

When the **Enable** box in a package's **Keybindings** section is un-checked and Atom is re-started, the **Keybindings** section disappears, making it impossible to re-enable the package's default keybindings by checking the **Enable** box.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Uncheck the **Enable** box in a package's **Keybindings** settings (e.g. the bracket-matcher package).
2. Re-start Atom.
3. Notice that the **Keybindings** settings section has completely disappeared from the package's settings; therefore, there is no way to re-enable the package's **Keybindings** by re-checking the **Enable** box, because there is no **Enable** box to check.

**Expected behavior:**

After unchecking the **Enable** box in the packages **Keybindings** section and re-starting Atom, it should still be possible to see the **Keybindings** section with an un-checked **Enable** box.

**Actual behavior:**

On the package's settings page there is no longer a **Keybindings** section between the **Settings** section and the **README** section.

**Workaround:**

Edit the Atom config file and remove the entry for the package from the `packagesWithKeymapsDisabled` section.

"336","Add Project Folder should open something relevant to the current context","### Description

Issue is similar to #6762, but it happens when adding a project folder. It then opens the ""Recently Used"" view on Linux, rather than something more relevant.

1. I'm assuming that just like #6762, this issue is not OS specific.
2. I see two potential candidates for a ""more relevant"" default:
    * The parent folder of the project folder that was added most recently.
    * The parent folder of the project folder of the currently opened file.

The former ""feels more correct"" (opinion), the latter is more in line with the fix for #6762

### Steps to Reproduce

1. In the menu, click on File
2. Select ""Add Project Folder...""

**Expected behavior:** An open folder dialog should appear, and show either the parent of the most recently added project folder, or the parent folder of the currently selected file's project folder.

**Actual behavior:** An open folder dialog appears, showing ""Recently Used"" items.

"337","Support MacBook Touch Bar","Would be really nice to have the ability to create Packages for Touch Bar actions. I think it would be nice to maybe have a basic package from Atom. If you want to go specialised you can write your own and add or replace the standard actions.
For example, I would love to see Indent and Outdent buttons. The `⌘+]` shortcut is on my german keyboard pretty hard to remember as I have to press `⌘+alt+6`.

### Description

Updated Atom by official RPM.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open Atom.

**Expected behavior:** Atom opens

**Actual behavior:** `/usr/share/atom/atom: error while loading shared libraries: libXss.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

### Workaround

```
$ pkcon install libXScrnSaver
```

Atom 1.12beta7 on Debian Stretch (testing).

### Description

My keyboard is using Colemak. Shortcuts only work in their QWERTY positions.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use Colemak layout
2. Open a file
3. Modify it
4. Try to save it via Colemak's Ctrl+S (which corresponds to the QWERTY position of Ctrl+D).

**Expected behavior:**
It should save the file (or prompt to save it as...)

**Actual behavior:**

It does not offer the options stated above.

** Workaround:**

Try to save it via QWERTY's Ctrl+S (which corresponds to the Colemak's position of Ctrl+R). It will work.

"350","Multi-cursor movement shouldn't jump to the last cursor","Repro steps:
- Open a file with a few hundred lines
- Find a word that's used in many parts of the file
- cmd-ctrl-g on this word to create a cursor on all the occurrences
- see that it moves to the last occurrence. **Intended behavior:** shouldn't move
- scroll all the way up to the first occurrence
- hit the right arrow
- see that it moves to the last occurrence. **Intended behavior:** shouldn't move

Why does it happen?

The screen movement logic is encoded in the single cursor implementation:
https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/0e992326154d387611543f618ad5872dc4665586/src/cursor.coffee#L255-L268

And the cursor movement action just delegates to all the cursors:
https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/f726dcc81bcd88eb7aff1e61bd77484b875f0854/src/text-editor.coffee#L2153-L2154

So, what happens is that we're going to iterate over all the cursors, and set the screen position on all of them and the last one is going to win.

Instead, **what should happen** is that if the screen is currently under any of the cursors, don't move. If not, then find the nearest cursor and move to that one, instead of the last one.

cc @nathansobo do you have advice on how I can refactor this piece of code to solve the issue?

### Description

I'm fairly sure this will end up being an Electron issue, but here goes ...

When I start atom-beta (1.12.0b4, though was present with b3 at least), it spawns a shell ('env') subprocess which burns 100% CPU, attempting to read stdin forever:

```
systemd,1,1 --system --deserialize 126
  ├─atom,15392,10213
  │   ├─atom,15403,10213
  │   │   └─atom,15466,10213
  │   │       ├─zsh,15497,10213 -ilc command env
```

strace on the shell shows this looping forever:

```
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], [TSTP TTIN TTOU], 8) = 0
read(0, NULL, 0)                        = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [TSTP TTIN TTOU], [], 8) = 0
getpgrp()                               = 10213
ioctl(15, TIOCGPGRP, [11445])           = 0
getpgrp()                               = 10213
ioctl(15, TIOCGPGRP, [11445])           = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], [TSTP TTIN TTOU], 8) = 0
read(0, NULL, 0)                        = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [TSTP TTIN TTOU], [], 8) = 0
```

Sometimes this process blocks Atom startup, and you have to kill the shell for Atom's window to show. Sometimes Atom works just fine despite this, and you only realise later when you wonder why your system is slow, and kill the extraneous process. Sometimes closing Atom takes the rogue shell process with it, and sometimes it outlives Atom. Sometimes everything works fine and I can't reproduce it at all.

Either way, safe mode or not has no effect on it, and nothing bright turns up with `--enable-logging`. Timecop shows 'window load time' taking an ungodly amount of time, but with no insight into why.

Happy to supply more details or attempt debugging as needed, with the caveat that I have no idea what I'm doing in JavaScript.

### Description

I stumbled upon this subword selection feature (really nice :smile:). However I do have some painpoints related to how the selection stops.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Write this on an empty editor.

```
this is   an example
this_is_an_example
THIS_IS_AN_EXAMPLE
THIS_is_anExample
this_is   an_example
thisIsAnExample
this__is___an__example
```
1. Position your cursor on the beginning of the file and execute `editor:select-to-end-of-word` 4 times, take note of the behavior.
2. Position your cursor back to the beginning of the file.
3. Execute `editor:select-to-next-subword-boundary` 4 times.
4. If there are more lines, go to the beginning of the next line and go to step 4 until all lines are processed.

**Expected behavior:**
Every line had the same behavior on step 4 compared to what happened on step 2.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]
On step 4...
- :x:  Line 1 stopped at spaces which is ok, but the next execution should select the spaces plus the next word.
- :white_check_mark: Line 2 behaved just as expected. 
- :x: Line 3 behaved like line 1 but with underscores instead of spaces.
- :x: Line 4 just like line 1 did the same on the first underscore, but not on the second one.
     It did stop at the ""camel case"".
- :x: Line 5 worked as expected selecting the underscores worked, but not the space.
- :white_check_mark: Line 6 as expected.
- :white_check_mark: Line 7 same.

### Description

This function:

```
atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor:not([mini])', 'editor:scroll-down': ->
  ed = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()
  ed.scrollToScreenPosition([ed.getLastVisibleScreenRow()-1,0])
```

on many/most files behaves as expected, visibly scrolling the cursor down one line.

But performing it on [atom-keymap's keymap-manager.coffee](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/blob/master/src/keymap-manager.coffee), it consistently scrolls down 2 lines.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open [atom-keymap's keymap-manager.coffee](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/blob/master/src/keymap-manager.coffee)
2. Execute both lines in the function above via the dev tools console.

It might be necessary to change text size to reproduce, but I've seen it at the default size, too. A couple cmd-+'s then cmd-0 usually does the trick.

**Expected behavior:**

Scroll the editor down one line.

**Actual behavior:**

The editor scrolls down two lines

### Description

I've just installed Atom and the current scrollbar implementation is very frustrating. If I want to scroll with my touchpad, I have to target the scrollbar explicitly, instead of just dragging the cursor to the rightmost edge and drag the code down.

This is a human-computer interface antipattern.

Please read this: http://particletree.com/features/visualizing-fittss-law/ especially the section ""Rule of the Infinite Edge""

I could just repeat everything that the article says. For a text editor where I can spend most of my time during the day, this should be a no brainier to implement.

### Description

When using a custom keyboard layout (e.g. Dvorak), characters are entered correctly when typing, however, key bindings are mapped as if I am using QWERTY layout.

(making Atom unusable for me)
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Type normally using DVORAK layout
2. Use any keybinding (e.g. ctrl-c)

**Expected behavior:** Selected text is copied (when using ctrl+c)

**Actual behavior:** ctrl+i is triggered

If you execute `pane:close` the dialog asking you to save appears twice when you press the `Dont Save` button. This does not happen with `core:close` command in combination with the `Close Empty Panes` configuration option.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Atom in safe mode.
1. Ensure you only have one pane, this bug does not reproduce when closing a split pane.
1. Open a new untitled tab (Or any tab it is not limited to untitled tabs).
1. Make any modifications to the tab.
1. Run `pane:close` from the `command-palette`, this doesn't reproduce when the pane is closed using the `Remove Empty Panes` option.
1. In the dialog that appears press `Don't Save`.

"367","Can not dismiss ""No update available"" window if opening menu again before the update check finishes","### Description

So I just discovered a weird little issue. If I use ""check for updates"" from the menu, and before the window pops up I open the Atom-menu again I can not dismiss the ""No updates available"" window neither press something in the menu. The only way to exit Atom is to kill the process using Activity Monitor.
- It happens in safe mode as well.
- I am running version 1.10.2
- No error pops up
- Trying to close in any other way that using Activity Monitor fails.

I am using a Macbook Pro Retina 13"" (late 2013) with MacOS 10.12 (sierra) installed.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Atom.
2. Go to Atom menu and select ""Check for Update""
3. Before the window appears (telling you there are no updates) open the Atom menu again.
4. Wait a bit.
5. When the update-check window appears try to click whatever. It is no longer possible to close the menu, ok the update-check window.

### Description

`editor:duplicate-lines` should only duplicate at most once per line when using multiple cursors. 

This would allow for easier duplication of many use cased such as duplicating and changing inputs, imports, markdown tables etc.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create an empty document
2. Add the following content -
   
   ```
   <input name=""foo"" id=""foo""/>
   ```
3. Highlight either of `foo` texts
4. Press `shift-cmd-D` or whatever your associated keybindings for `editor:duplicate-lines` is.

**Expected behavior:** One new line should be created with both `foo` strings highlighted on the new line.

**Actual behavior:** Two new lines are created with the highlighted `foo` strings being one per line.

### Description

The ""Atomic Soft Tabs"" setting cannot be disabled - or more clearly, the checkbox that is on by default can be unselected, but the effect of cursor skipping over soft tabs does not change.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Ensure that ""soft tabs"" and ""show invisibles"" settings are on, and Tab Type is set to auto/soft.
2. Create a new file, and press the tab key to indent.
3. Observe that 4 ""dots"" appear to represent the tab as four spaces, i.e. a soft tab.
4. move the cursor using the keyboard, and observe if the cursor skips over the spaces as a whole, or allows the cursor to move over each space one by one. Also try and select a middle space using the mouse cursor.

**Expected behavior:** with the 'Atomic Soft Tabs' setting off, I would expect the cursor to be able to select spaces within a soft tab.

**Actual behavior:** the cursor skips over all the spaces, i.e. Atomic Soft Tab behaviour.

why ?
the current atom editor has all the proper looks like any other major one, but severely lacks the feeling. Sublime, textmate and others have implemented smooth scrolling which gives an easy to fallow sensation when scrolling thru the code, this is a feature that makes an incredibly difference in terms of comfort and new users adoption.

whats wrong with the current alternatives ?
the css wont work with the new tile rendering system, see https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5359
""scroll sensitivity"" works only when using a mouse or trackpad, besides the ""steeps"" between every scroll update aren't smooth at all.

I propose an artificial delay in the same way that a linear transition of -webkit-transform would work over the tiles.

### Description

Atom IDE recovers poorly when it's forced-closed after encountering a performance issue.  I searched for this issue but don't see it, although maybe it's worded differently.
### Steps to Reproduce
1.  Cause AtomIDE to hang.  To do this, create a file with very long lines that must be syntax-colored.  In most operating systems a dialog prompt will appear to ""force close"" the app.
2.  Force close Atom when prompted by the OS.
3.  Wait several seconds for any OS logging/recovery.
4.  Re-launch Atom.
5.  Atom re-opens the same files already open during the previous session.  The same long-lines must syntax-colored and Atom will hang again, repeating this entire cycle.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]
It seems like a good idea to remember the documents that were open last.  However that backfires in this case.  Might as well detect a crash and clear the previous documents list to avoid an infinite loop of use-cases.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]
AtomIDE re-opens the same files that were open before hanging and force-closed, and ends up the same cycle.

### Description

Opening a new document defaults to ""Plain Text"" syntax. You can save the file with a select file extension or manually select a syntax but cannot set the default syntax for new documents. An official init.coffee solution exists on the [Atom FAQ](https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-can-i-make-all-new-files-open-with-a-specific-grammar-or-syntax/20754) however new documents still default to ""Plain Text"" and rather only opening a new tab defaults to the desired syntax:

```
atom.workspace.observeTextEditors (editor) ->
  if editor.getTitle() is ""untitled""
    editor.setGrammar(atom.grammars.grammarForScopeName('text.html.php'))
```

Other developers have noted the bug appears to be, ""Open Empty Editor On Start option enabled is required as this issue only occurs on the first editor created by that option.""
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Edit init.coffee with above code
2. Restart Atom
3. Open Atom and notice default syntax is still Plain Text

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]
Default syntax (based on above code) should be PHP
**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]
It is still Plain Text (unless you open another tab via shortcut or Menu). Opening New Window view menu or shortcut also results in same issue.

The method `suggestedIndentForTokenizedLineAtBufferRow` is called with `bufferRow`, `line`, `tokenizedLine` containing information about the line that is to be indented. The indentation is based on the indentation of the previous line (duh), but at the highlighted lines `increaseIndentRegex` may not belong to the scope of that previous line.

For instance in Blade it's possible to embed a block of PHP in a following manner

``` blade
@php
echo ""hello world"";
@endphp
```

For sake of simplicity let's say Blade has defined `increaseIndentPattern` is `@php` and `decreaseIndentPattern` is `@endphp` for its scope.

When `suggestedIndentForTokenizedLineAtBufferRow` is calculating the indentation for the line containing `echo` statement, then at the highlighted section it looks for the previous line: `@php` and tries to match `increaseIndentPattern` of the current line, which is of different scope (`.source.php`) and is different from Blade's scope, meaning the `increaseIndentPattern` of `@php` is never hit.

"382","Cursor in unexpected position when moving it while selecting","Observed in Atom 1.10.2 on Windows 10 Home using Atom One UI Theme and Atom Light syntax theme.
1. Create a new file and enter some lines of text in it. Make sure there are around 40 characters per line.
2. Position your cursor somewhere halfway the second line (say, column 20)
3. Hold Shift and move the cursor up one line using the arrow Up key
4. Observe: The cursor is in the expected position, line 1 column 20, exactly one column above where it was before, and text from where the cursor is now up to where it was before is now selected
5. Release the Shift key
6. Press the Up key on the keyboard
7. Observe: The text is no longer selected (expected)
8. Observe: The cursor is now at the beginning of the line (column 1) (**not** expected)
9. Press the Down key on the keyboard
10. Observe: The cursor is now on line 2, column 1.

Expected behavior: Since we started on line 2 and are on line 1 at step 6, it's not possible to go up one more line so I would expect the cursor to remain where it is. I do expect to lose the selection when I attempt to move the cursor, but I don't expect it to move to the beginning of the line. 

The problem with the current behavior is that when you do Up, Down, you don't return to where you were before. This gives unexpected cursor 'jumps' when editing.

I compared with Microsoft Notepad and Notepad++

**MS Notepad:**
Behaves as I would expect. The cursor remains at it's position when we press Up on line 1, selection is lost

**Notepad++**
Has some mysterious behavior of itself. It also moves the cursor to column 1 when we press up (like Atom), but, crucially, when we press Down it moves the cursor back to where it was. This is actually also unexpected

I guess it's a minor issue. But I've found myself selecting the wrong stuff / deleting the wrong parts of a line etc when editing from muscle memory and I've traced it back to this quirk. I think it would improve the editing experience if it was fixed.

Also, note that if we don't hold Shift when moving Up and Down, Atom behaves as Notepad++:
When we press Up while the cursor is on line 1, it visually moves to the beginning of the line, however if we then press Down it actually moves back to where it was before, therefore maintaining command symmetry. This behavior changes (for the worse imho) when we hold Shift to select some text.

"385","`PaneContainer::getPanes()` doesn't include added pane in `onDidAddPane` or `observePanes` callback","It's hard to know if this is a bug or not, but it was certainly unexpected for me. Also, it makes things more complicated than they should be since you have to maintain your own state (list of panes) instead of relying on `PaneContainer::getPanes()`.
### Steps to Reproduce

``` js
atom.workspace.paneContainer.onDidAddPane(event => {
  if (atom.workspace.paneContainer.getPanes().indexOf(event.pane) === -1) {
    throw new Error(""That's weird."");

Then split a pane.

**Expected behavior:** No error. (The pane has been added when the did-add-pane event is emitted.)

### Description

After the Electron 1.3.5 upgrade, I've noticed a complete loss of subpixel antialiasing in Atom.  Code, tree-view, status-bar, you name it are all grayscale antialiased.  If there's any way I can help debug this please let me know because it's starting to hurt my eyes :(.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. `atom --safe`
2. Zoom in using Magnify

**Expected behavior:** Colorful subpixel antialiasing

**Actual behavior:** Grayscale :(

"387","Upgrading packages doesn't recalculate canDeferMainModuleRequire using new code","Recently, we (the Nuclide team) got bitten by what seems to be a bug in Atom's package manager when we switched from loading our ""sub-packages"" during Nuclide's activation phase to its loading phase.

It seems that, if you upgrade a package from within Atom, its new metadata (including the version) will be loaded immediately but `Package::load()` will still load the old version of the package ([because of the require cache](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v1.11.0-beta5/src/package.coffee#L441)). It'll then use that code to determine whether requiring the main module can be deferred and cache that in local storage. The next time Atom's loaded, it uses the (potentially inaccurate) cached value.

We noticed this because our code changed from allowing the deferment of requiring the main module to not, but Atom continued to defer loading.

"388","Sub-pixel rendering does not occur when unlocking Atom on Macbook external monitor","### Description

When unlocking mac OS on a macbook when atom is on a second monitor, the color of syntax highlighting is muted. The color fixes when the pane is updated by changing tabs. The screenshot below shows the muted color on the left, and the correct color (by changing the tab) on the right.

This does not appear to happen when waking the computer if atom is on the laptop screen. Its hard to tell, but the color appears to be fine for a split second, and then muted once the window is force-resized. This may happen on a desktop, but I don't have one to test with.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1187432/18359997/297866f2-75b1-11e6-898f-417644b42c35.png)
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Atom on a second, external monitor on a macbook
2. Allow Mac to lock from inactivity OR lock from the lock in the toolbar. The System ""Sleep"" command will not work.
3. Wake the mac, and unlock the screen

**Expected behavior:** Color should appear normally

**Actual behavior:** Color is <s>muted</s> not sub-pixel rendered. Thanks to @simurai  for noticing

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `atom -d -f .` or use the `Run package specs` command 
2. Notice how nothing appears

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]
- With `atom -d` a new Atom window should open in dev mode.
- With `Run package specs`, a new window with the test runner should appear.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]

Nothing happen at all. With `atom -d` the app starts (a new icon appears in the dock) but the window never appear. Only with the `-f` option the cause of the issue can be discovered.

### Description

Closing a split pane when soft wrapped does not cause the spell check markers to get repositioned. Doing almost any action while in this state causes them to reposition correctly. Actions that cause them to reposition are: resize the Atom window, click in the `TextEditor`, scroll the `TextEditor`, switch to another tab and back, use the arrow keys to move the cursor.
I can reproduce this with all themes in safe mode on both Windows 10 and Windows 7.

Discovered and discussed over in https://github.com/atom/language-gfm/issues/167#issuecomment-244906162 where @nathansobo told me to open a new issue.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Atom in safe mode.
2. Ensure you have `Soft Wrap` enabled.
3. Ensure you have `spell-check` enabled.
4. Copy [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Ben3eeE/6b9a8d5c3fbdd38bda3b70b63617b280/raw/77e0fc174f27160e82bd3c27f2d8182771770fb8/gistfile1.txt) into a new untitled `TextEditor` 
5. Split the pane right and resize the Atom window so there is soft wrapping.
6. Close the right pane that you just opened.

Gif of reproduction Windows 7 safe mode:
![split pane close](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1058982/18268989/8712b448-7426-11e6-814c-adf8b998e353.gif)

**Expected behavior:** Spell check markers to be correctly positioned.

**Actual behavior:** Spell check markers are incorrectly positioned. Doing anything like moving the cursor, clicking in the pane causes them to reposition correctly.

"393","missing first letter on file operations (cut/copy/rename exc.)","Hi there. This is not an Atom bug but one of its dependencies. I open this issue here because I couldn't find the responsible package. 

I also encounter this bug in gulp (3 & 4), glob and a couple of other packages.
### Description

When you use capital 'i'  ( İ ) in directory names on Turkish environments,  first letter of directory vanishes at the end of the operation. 

Ex: When I rename a file like this in Atom (`\project-dir` is the root path of the project folder) `C:\Dev\İpler\project-dir\subdir\file.js` the renaming window opens file as `ubdir\file.js` 
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a directory that contains/starts a capital `i` (İ) letter on its path names.
2. Create a sub directory in that directory that going to be a project folder.
3. Open Atom with that path
4. Create a file under sub directory.

See my packages's travis-ci log [here](https://travis-ci.org/gandm/language-babel/jobs/156550748), it doesn't even start the atom install! The same batch of tests work on Linux Deb stable
### Steps to Reproduce

run a travis-ci 

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]

Atom to install and sepcs to run

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]

### Description

I reported this issue gandm/language-babel#234 and @gandm very eloquently explained what the underlying cause of the problem is. Rather than attempt to rephrase, I shall simply quote from [here](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel/issues/234#issuecomment-242779428):

> Little bit complex but it appears that [autoflow](https://github.com/atom/autoflow/blob/master/lib/autoflow.coffee#L18) attempts to determine the line that the cursor is on is part of a paragraph. This eventually calls [language-mode](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/language-mode.coffee#L196) which eventually determines [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/language-mode.coffee#L212) that this line isn't a comment line because my grammar doesn't set the whitespace preceeding the // as a comment ( **because it isn't!** ) and therefore determines that this line is part of a paragraph including the line above.

Thus, I'm reporting the issue here.

It might be a design decision, and in fact not a bug at all, but intended behaviour, but such considerations are beyond me, so I'm posting here anyway, feel free to close if this is the intended behaviour.
### Steps to Reproduce

Unfortunately I'm not sure if I can make a reproduction now as @gandm has already changed the approach taken by the language-babel plugin which circumvents this issue.

### Description

The bug has since been reported in several places. The current use case that bothers is that `console.log` is used in the [`eslint-plugin-react`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) which is used in the widely adopted [`eslint-config-airbnb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) which is in turn consumed by [`eslint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) and [`AtomLinter/linter-eslint`](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint).
- https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/issues/579 (closed because the AtomLinter team cannot do anything with that)
- https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/416#issuecomment-177119027 (closed because the issue was not stated properly, or simply comments on closed issues were ignored)
- https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/978#issuecomment-241332995 (can't be fixed in eslint-config-airbnb yet because of other dependencies)
- https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/783#issuecomment-241778161 (looks like a won't fix because eslint-plugin-react ""is a Node module, so using console is valid"")

Here's the exception that pops up in Atom:

```
Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, write
    at Error (native)
    at Object.fs.writeSync (fs.js:706:20)
    at SyncWriteStream.write (fs.js:2064:6)

    at CommentEventGenerator.enterNode (__CENSORED__\node_modules\eslint\lib\util\comment-event-generator.js:97:23)
```

Here's one of the faulty lines:
https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/v3.16.1/lib/rules/jsx-quotes.js#L52

``` js
      /* eslint-disable no-console */
      console.log('The react/jsx-quotes rule is deprecated. Please use the jsx-quotes rule instead.');
      /* eslint-enable no-console */
      isWarnedForDeprecation = true;
```

There are more occurences of this pattern in `eslint-plugin-react`:
https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/e84af68a3bf48c9a34f14e73a8b4dc1ed7488bab/lib/rules/require-extension.js#L103

``` js
        /* eslint-disable no-console */
        console.log('The react/require-extension rule is deprecated. Please ' +
                    'use the import/extensions rule from eslint-plugin-import instead.');
        /* eslint-enable no-console */
        isWarnedForDeprecation = true;
```

https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=console.log&type=Code
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install `atom-linter`, `atom-linter-eslint` plugins, `eslint` and `eslint-plugin-react` modules.
2. Use a `.eslintrc` that uses one of the `eslint-plugin-react`'s deprecated rules; for example, the `eslint-config-airbnb` base config.
3. Run the linting on a JS file.

**Expected behavior:** No error.

**Actual behavior:** The exception mentioned above.

Some people design themes for specific languages or tasks.

### Description

When you press <kbd>ctrl+shift+o</kbd> to open a project folder the dialog defaults to the current file name, which is not a valid folder.

Screenshot where I had a file in the spec folder open and wanted to open that folder in a separate Atom window using <kbd>ctrl+shift+o</kbd> and then <kbd>enter</kbd>.
In addition I also noticed that the entire file name is not shown in the dialog. Compare error dialog text with open folder dialog text.
![not a folder](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1058982/17764625/bd71fb3a-6520-11e6-9347-936b3f1fa73d.png)
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Atom in safe mode, add a project folder and open a file.
2. With the file focused press <kbd>ctrl+shift+o</kbd>
3. Try to open that folder by just pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> on the dialog, error because the folder is set incorrectly to a filename.

**Expected behavior:** The current open files folder opens as a project folder in a new Atom window. 

**Actual behavior:** Error because file name is set to a file instead of a folder, if you clear the file name from the dialog before opening it opens the folder as expected.

### Steps to Reproduce

```
$ mkdir gittest
$ cd gittest 
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/swrobel/Code/gittest/.git/
$ touch this-should-be-tracked
$ echo 'this-should-be-tracked' >> ~/.gitignore_global  
$ git status --ignored
On branch master

Initial commit

Ignored files:
  (use ""git add -f <file>..."" to include in what will be committed)

    this-should-be-tracked

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use ""git add"" to track)
$ echo '!this-should-be-tracked' >> .gitignore           
$ git status --ignored                        
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use ""git add <file>..."" to include in what will be committed)

    .gitignore
    this-should-be-tracked

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use ""git add"" to track)
$ atom .
```

**Expected behavior:**
According to the [gitignore docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), `.gitignore` files local to a  project take precedence over `.gitignore_global`. In this case a simple single-file rule has been added to `.gitignore_global` and then negated in the project's `.gitignore` file, which means that it should be tracked in git, and thus, in my mind, is not a ""VCS Ignored Path.""

Note: I have avoided using `git check-ignore` because of the [rather confusing behavior](https://public-inbox.org/git/1418323355-23935-1-git-send-email-florian.hassanen@gmail.com/) where it returns files that match any gitignore rule, including negated rules, rather than only returning files that will actually be ignored.

**Actual behavior:**
File is not available in Fuzzy Finder, Tree View, or other areas that respect the VCS Ignored Paths setting.

### Description

Existing editors (ie those that are opened automatically upon opening an existing project) do not show indent guides.  New editors (ie those that are opened after Atom loads the existing project) do.  In addition, closing the existing editors and reopening them will cause them to start showing indent guides.  I believe this started after the TextEditor extraction PR, though I'm not completely sure.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Atom and add a project folder (making sure the indent guides option is enabled)
2. Open some files
3. Close Atom
4. Open Atom again, making sure it restores the project folder and files added in step 1
5. Note that no indent guides are shown
6. Open a different file and note that indent guides are shown on that file only
7. Close one of the existing files and reopen it and notice that indent guides are now shown on that file as well

**Expected behavior:** Indent guides to always show if the option is enabled

**Actual behavior:** Indent guides do not show on existing editors until they are reopened

The problem is that this is created with a generic name, but it is owned by the active user and no other users can modify it (which **is** how it should be -- in fact, it could be argued that no other users should be allowed to read it).

The problem comes when I try to switch users in MacOS 10, using fast-user switching.  If I try to start up Atom on a second userid, and if I have the console.app running, I'll see an endless stream of error messages:

``` cr
<timestamp> PM crashpad_handler[<pid>]: [0814/212739:ERROR:file_io_posix.cc(153)] open /tmp/Atom Crashes/settings.dat: Permission denied
```

I have to switch back to the first userid, bring up Terminal, and `rm -rf /tmp/Atom*`.  And of course this means that Atom.app cannot be left running on two different sessions at the same time, which is disappointing.

If Atom is going to create a directory in /tmp, then it should include the userid (or the user's UID) in the name of the directory.  I think the directory should also be created with permissions 700, not 755.

I notice that in MacOS 10, the directory has the attribute:

``` cr
# ls -ld@ /tmp/Atom\ Crashes
drwxr-xr-x@ 6 gad  wheel  204 Aug 14 21:42 /tmp/Atom Crashes/
    org.chromium.crashpad.database.initialized    1 
```

if that helps to track this down.

FWIW:

This happened to the Atom editor. 
- [ ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?

Just did, this was not a crash (closed properly), but when it restarted all the packages were missing.

### Description

Atom deleted all of my packages and themes upon application restart. Not really sure how else to elaborate on this, but pretty much reverted to base install (maybe more basic as file explorer is not present on left-hand-side as well).  
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Have a lot of tabs open (I had my React project open at the time and had my README.md, and many Javascript files)
2. Notable installed packages include those needed to run .eslintrc file (eslint-plugin-{react, lodash, etc.}, eslint)
3. Delete tabs by using shortcut Cmd + W really fast
4. Reopen Atom by typing in Terminal atom . in targeted directory
5. cry

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]

Atom closes and starts up again with all packages and themes present. File explorer present on left hand side. 

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]

Atom deleted all themes and packages. ~/.atom directory still exists, ~/.atom/packages does not. No green square on bottom-left-hand-side (not sure if I should be looking for this.)
Still present: all directory files (Atom did not touch any of my files, and since I had just pushed to devel branch there weren't any unsaved changes to any files so I don't know if those would have been lost or not).

Chrome for example does so. However this is not simply a cosmetic change! It also allows for themes to replace certain icons while preserving the icons of apps with no altered icon.

The bug is still present in the master branch as of now.

### Description

When calling Workspace::scan with the `paths` option set, any ignored paths due to `core.excludeVcsIgnoredPaths` or `core.ignoredNames` are not ignored.

This was originally reported in atom/find-and-replace#621, and seems to be a problem with Workspace::scan.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Merge my PR with additional specs (see below)
2. Unskip the new tests (xit -> it)
3. Run `apm test` and observe the failures

**Expected behavior:** Tests pass - ignored paths are correctly ignored when the `paths` option is set.

**Actual behavior:** Tests fail - ignored paths are not ignored when the `paths` option is set.

"412","Add prevent option to ::onWillDestroyPaneItem()","Might be useful as a reference: [::onWillDestroyPaneItem() documentation](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.9.7/Workspace#instance-onWillDestroyPaneItem)

**Steps which explain the enhancement**

``` coffeescript
atom.workspace.onWillDestroyPaneItem (event) =>
    event.prevent()
```
1. Call `.prevent()` on the event given as argument to the callback function in `::onWillDestroyPaneItem`.
2. `.prevent()` can toggle a boolean variable on the `.item`, letting the system know it should not be closed.
3. Instead of closing the pane item, the boolean variable will be toggled back.

**Current and suggested behavior**

Currently there is no way to prevent closing a tab via the JavaScript of a package. But a user of my package [pinned-tabs](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/pinned-tabs-for-atom) suggested [a feature](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/pinned-tabs-for-atom/issues/20) that requires this functionality. All this suggestion should really add is a way to prevent closing a tab when Atom reached the 'WillDestroy' state.

**Why would the enhancement be useful to most users**

It will mostly be useful for people that want to create a package that in one way or another have 'priority' tabs that they don't want to be closed when for example the close-all-tabs command is fired.

### Description

When pasting a long one-line text that forces the view to scroll horizontally or vertically, the scrollbar stays at its initial position. The problem seems to only occur if there is no scrollbar present. When trying to achieve the same result when there is already a scrollbar visible, it will work fine.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Atom in safe mode
1. Open a new untitled tab
1. Paste the contents of  [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Ben3eeE/6b9a8d5c3fbdd38bda3b70b63617b280/raw/77e0fc174f27160e82bd3c27f2d8182771770fb8/gistfile1.txt) in to the new untitled tab.
1. **Expected:** Scrollbar to be at the bottom since the TextEditor is scrolled to the  bottom. **Acutal:** Scrollbar stays at the top of the file. This bug applies to both vertical and horizontal scrollbars.

**Expected behavior:** 

The scrollbar should appear and then indicate that the view has been scrolled.

**Actual behavior:** 

The scrollbar didn't indicate that the site was scrolled. It stayed at its initial position on the left.

### Description

My package has a `grammar-used` activation hook, as per #8313 it is triggered on opening a new file but not on opening a previous session.

I have observed this working correctly at some point in an earlier version, but can't say how long ago.
### Steps to Reproduce

(as per #8313)
1. Install language-purescript and ide-purescript
2. Open a file with `.purs` extension - observe package starts
3. Close atom
4. Re-open atom (so file is still open)

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]
-  Package is started

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]
-  Package does not start
-  Package can be observed to neither be started nor activated (via console.log on startup)
-  Opening a new file which was not already open will start the package as normal (but not switching to one of the existing files)

### Description

`ctrl+alt+cmd+L` (or `cmd+R` with the dev tools open) with an unsaved editor will reload to an empty window because of:

```

(anonymous function)  @ /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/atom-environment.js:752
```
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Using either Atom 1.9.0 or Atom 1.10.0-beta0 (in safe mode or not), have an unsaved editor and no project
2. Press `ctrl+opt+cmd+L`,
3. Reload to a blank screen (check the console for the error),
4. Press `ctrl+opt+cmd+L` to re-reload,
5. Works again.

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]

For the `ctrl+opt+cmd+L` reload to work fine the first time.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]

Had to reload twice because the first time throws an error that leaves Atom in an unusable state.
### Versions

You can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.

Atom 1.9.0 and Atom 1.10.0-beta0, on macOS 10.11.

### Description

This drove me up the wall while trying to figure out why deserialization wasn't working in the rewritten about package (damn you CoffeeScript implicit returns!) – deserializer functions must return an object, but we currently don't provide any feedback to package authors that this is the case. We should either throw an error or log a warning to make this clearer, and also update the docs [here](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.8.0/DeserializerManager#instance-add) to specify the expected return value of a deserializer.

There isn't also an option to force the refresh of the file (os is there?). This is very annoying when I can change the file outside atom (for instance by updating my repository).

Other editors detect when the file changes, signalize it and offer the user the ability to reload it, or to overwrite it.

"426","when opening a file with a line number, atom should scroll down to display that line number at the top of the view","### Description

When opening atom from the command line, to a specific file and line number, atom does not scroll the content in the most desirable manner...
### Steps to Reproduce
1. atom text/someFile.txt:115

**Expected behavior:** I expect Atom to scroll so that line number 115 is at the top of my editor

**Actual behavior:** Atom scrolls to the line number, but only far enough for it to be presented at the bottom of the screen. Furthermore, plugins like JSHint that are displayed at the bottom will cover the desired line number. Therefore, the user still has to scroll the content to view the line number, defeating the entire purpose of this feature.

### Description

When editing a text file, any changes including new lines that are applied using the redo option appear to be coerced to LF endings instead of CRLF endings as one might expect on Windows. I've only noticed this recently while editing files with some linter packages, which immediately highlight inconsistencies with line endings.

See my screen capture below for an illustration of this problem.

![redoproblem](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2031402/16984950/df07d2ce-4eaf-11e6-8c07-4e8b300ec2a9.gif)

I had a quick poke around the Atom code base but nothing stood out to me. It's probably something to do with the `text-buffer` dependency.
### Steps to Reproduce

Enabling invisible characters will help visualise this problem.
1. Open a new file in Atom and add some lines using the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key.
2. Undo all the lines (i.e. <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>).
3. Redo all the lines (i.e. <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd>).

**Expected behavior:** All the line endings inserted by the redo action should use CRLF endings instead of LF.

**Actual behavior:** Redo actions insert LF endings.

- [ ] When `showInvisibles` is on, all normally non-visible characters (control characters, zero-width spaces, other Unicode weirdness, etc) should be rendered in some way #1839
- [ ] There should be some way of customizing which non-visible characters are displayed when `showInvisibles` is on (Perhaps by class? i.e. whitespace, control characters, Unicode groups)

"437","Issue changing focus to a fullscreen Atom instance on OSX","### Description

I have an Atom instance running in fullscreen mode and a terminal in fullscreen mode. If I use the `atom` command to open a file from the terminal the file opens but the window does not come into focus.

Some additional information is available in [the original discussion post](https://discuss.atom.io/t/issue-changing-focus-to-a-fullscreen-atom-instance-on-osx/30458), though the relevant information is reproduced here.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open an Atom workspace and put the window in fullscreen mode using the green button in the upper-left corner.
2. Open an terminal window and make it fullscreen as well.
3. Run the command `atom foo.txt:7` in the terminal (where `foo.txt` is an actual file).

**Expected behavior:** The file should open in the existing window and the Atom window should be in focus.

**Actual behavior:** The file is opening as expected, but the _desktop_ is in focus.
### Versions

Running on OS X 10.10.5.

output of `atom --version`:

```

"439","Implement clear for TextEditor in mini mode","It would be useful to implement a ""clear"" function on TextEditor when mini is enabled, that is optional and would allow to easily clear a field with a click as well as provide an event that is fired when the fields value becomes an empty string.

Visually it can look something like this and is only visible when the field has focus: 
![clear_field](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7757/16361433/61a15ed0-3b91-11e6-965b-e044f6cf695f.png)

If this would be an acceptable feature I would start implementing it to introduce it into [atom/settings-view](/atom/settings-view) to clear package searches.

"440","Spec stacktrace cut off","### Prerequisites
- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?
- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?
- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?
- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?
- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?
- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?
### Description

When running specs through the UI, the stacktraces have the potential to be cut off, like so:
![spec-stacktrace-cut-off](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2766036/16358793/4dfee28e-3aed-11e6-9503-73f08a737efa.png)
In that picture the column number isn't visible.  In more extreme cases the line number or even parts of the filename can be cut off as well.
(the stark white/black contrast also looks really ugly)
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Have a sufficiently long directory structure to where the specs are located
2. Purposely create a failing test
3. `window:run-package-specs`

**Expected behavior:** Being able to view the entire stack trace without having to resize the window (maybe by clicking on the stack trace)

**Actual behavior:** Stack trace is cut off at the end

"441","Running `atom` from the command line can un-set `process.env.NODE_DEV`, causing performance degradation & JS crashes","Unless Atom is running in dev mode, it sets `process.env.NODE_ENV` to ""production"". (The relevant code is here: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/a5fdf3e18a512349e7efb91b3c297b1a2b91bf63/src/initialize-application-window.coffee#L20) This improves the speed of React by disabling its debug mode.

But if Atom is already running, and already has `file.txt` open, and one runs `atom file.txt` from the command line, the command line's environment is used to overwrite Atom's current `process.env`. Most people don't have `NODE_DEV` set in their environment, so React falls back to its slow debug mode. 

The code responsible for ""cloning"" the environment is https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/a5fdf3e18a512349e7efb91b3c297b1a2b91bf63/src/environment-helpers.js#L75 Notice that it deletes the existing environment.

If React starts in production mode, it won't create some key debugging data structures. If it later changes to dev mode (because `process.env.NODE_DEV` becomes undefined), it will try to access those structures and crash.

This bug is responsible for several reported issues in packages that I maintain: https://github.com/Floobits/atom-term3/issues/63

"448","Opening a file fails if update is ready (Mac OS X)","### Description

If Atom is running and an update is downloaded and ready to be installed, opening a new file from an external application (like Finder) will fail - rather than opening that file in the existing application instance a new instance of the application starts up, without any files. Worse yet, after closing the second instance and restarting the initial one the update is not installed and has to be downloaded again.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install Atom 1.8.0-beta4
2. Run Atom
3. Go to Atom menu, click ""Check for Update"" if that menu item is present.
4. Wait for the update to be downloaded (Atom menu will show something like ""Restart to install Atom 1.9.0-beta0"") but don't restart Atom.
5. Run from command line: `open -a 'Atom Beta' ~/.atom/init.coffee`

**Expected behavior:** A new tab is opened in the running Atom instance, allowing to edit the Atom init script.

**Actual behavior:** A second Atom instance starts up, without any tabs. Closing that instance and restarting the initial instance won't install the update, the update has to be downloaded again instead.

### Description

It seems that the Developer Tools has major issues determining the proper paths to files on Windows when the logged in user account has a space in their folder name. See the Actual behavior section for details.

I'm sure this bug has to have been reported before, but I couldn't find it when searching.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log into a user with a space in their user folder name (`C:\Users\Landon Abney\`)
2. Open Developer Tools

**Expected behavior:**
All files are correctly identified to their proper location, meaning _all_ package files are identified and shown properly in the Source tree.

**Actual behavior:**

Files that are recognized as under the `file://` domain are split between `C:\Users\User Name\` and `C:\Users\User%20Name\`.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427137/15867853/f6bb0b12-2c99-11e6-9b4b-01e6b20e9a5f.png)

The files under `file://C:/Users/Landon%20Abney/` also exhibit the odd behavior that the path is duplicated, but a few package's path's aren't:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427137/15868263/f29ca048-2c9b-11e6-87e6-27d11e8beff8.png)

While many files are only listed under the `(no domain)` categorization.

One group of these are shown as `/C:/Users/Landon%20Abney/.atom/packages/...`:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427137/15867942/556b99f6-2c9a-11e6-814a-5b19323f585c.png)

The majority of files are shown as `C:\Users\Landon Abney\.atom\packages`:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427137/15867998/92d16fe6-2c9a-11e6-9dca-b113a7f3e618.png)

I would expect _all_ of these files to be recognized as coming from the same folder, and shown properly in the Source tree. Often when working on a package the source file isn't listed under the `file://` domain, and I have to hunt through the huge list of `(no domain)` files, if it's even listed there.

### Description

**UPDATE: A simple mixin proposed solution is located at** https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11905#issuecomment-224336832

**PROBLEM: The functionality for `CMD +` is not accessible by packages and themes.**  Instead, [it is hardcoded to modify `atom-text-editor` element for `font-size` by hardcoding `#px` pixel value](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/6f1c1fd0e0242b096f4781698066788b26af2fa4/src/workspace-element.coffee#L54).

This does not allow the reuse of this functionality for custom packages and CSS.  The proposed solution noted at https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11905#issuecomment-224336832 is to move the variable it is modifying to a global mixin, for reuse at this same `atom-text-editor` element and `font-size` attribute.

An example use-case: When resizing the font size with CMD-+ (or CMD-SHIFT-+), only the Editor window is resized - not the TreeView, Tabs, StatusBar, ScrollBar, Dialogs (Find, Packages, etc), or anything else.  

BEFORE: Atom default font...

AFTER: pressing CMD-+ several times to greatly increase font size...
<img width=""1920"" alt=""screen shot 2016-06-05 at 11 03 34 am"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/104980/15806224/33e268d4-2b0d-11e6-84b1-69bbc841dfab.png"">

^- Only the Editor is resized, making the Treeview and Debugger and other dialogs extremely hard to read in screencasts/meetup presentations.

This is really needed, especially for doing Meetups Presentations, Screencasts and even Screen sharing/Code pairing sessions.  Just make a few CMD-+ to blow everything up to enormous size and everyone is happy. 

This was originally mentioned back in November 2015.

> Does anyone know how could I make @font-size change along with zoom levels? E.g. ctrl+/-/scroll-up/down. Thanks!
> https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2530#issuecomment-153580043

If we compare to VSCode, VSCode resizes everything with CMD-+ (Editor window, TreeView, Tabs, StatusBar, Scrollbar, dialogs, and everything else).  For example, here's VSCode before and after:

BEFORE: VSCode default font size...
<img width=""1920"" alt=""screen shot 2016-06-05 at 10 44 53 am"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/104980/15806121/9959af4a-2b0a-11e6-97ef-02f8f6fa23ac.png"">

AFTER: pressing CMD-+ a few times blows everything up large.
<img width=""1920"" alt=""screen shot 2016-06-05 at 10 40 08 am"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/104980/15806097/f23fe8be-2b09-11e6-9dac-bdd30a9cca78.png"">

^- that's a fullscreen shot at 3840x2400!

In summary, the root issue is that `CMD +` is modifying the base stylesheet directly.  We cannot access this functionality with custom packages and custom CSS.  If a mixin was used instead, simple CSS overrides for the user could reuse them, as noted above.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open a code file
2. Press CMD-+ a few times

**Expected behavior:** When pressing CMD-+, I expect a global mixin or some other variable to access for custom packages and custom CSS.

**Actual behavior:** There is no global mixin - it is hardcoded to change the base stylesheet.

It's possible to continue normally by clicking ""keep waiting"". I don't think Atom really crashes, so this dialog probably shouldn't appear. I think there's some sort of timeout _somewhere_ for something to happen after opening the right click menu. I haven't tested this on Windows / OS X.

3. Create a second, empty Atom window, and select it.
4. ""Open"" from the file menu (e.g. Cmd+O)
5. Select a file that's the folder that you added to the first window.

**Expected behavior:**
Atom opens that file in this new second window.

**Actual behavior:**
Atom fronts the first window and opens the file there. Since Atom windows can freeze opening large files (e.g. #8154), I want to avoid this.

If I want to move the last line in a file up I can do it by pressing Ctrl+Cmd+Arrow (Mac)

**Proper behavior:** 

If there is a newline character at the end of that line, it will change from 

```
Previous line
Last line
```

to

```
Last line
Previous line

**Wrong behavior:** 

But if there is no newline character at the end of the last line, the hotkey will just concatenate it with the previous line

"462","Code folding based on grammar instead of indentation","The actual folding mechanism is simply wrong and unreliable.
I often work with big files and use folding to speed up my work.

But, if the file has a wrong indentation (something not rare if the files are human edited) atom also fold the code in a wrong manner. 
This in some case can be extremely dangerous , because if you don't remember to check every time what is folded you take that as given and work on the other parts of the file in a wrong manner.

The actual code folding is based firstly on indentation then on grammar.

I think that the code folding should be based ONLY on grammar.
Because, actually, even when you have a correct grammar (with correct folding rules) you can't be sure that the editor fold the code in the right manner.

Here is some examples to show , editing an XML file (**i want to fold at line number 10**):

**Unfolded text (with wrong indentation at line 18 and 19)**:

But for achieve this we must fix the indentation (on line 18 and 19):

I think that correct indentation CAN'T be a requirement to correct code folding.

### Description

A file present in a position not mounted get autosaved by a blank file and there is not a possibility to revert.
This bug happens to me since a script automatically mount in a folder my working dir thanks to my `~/.bashrc`. But sometimes it fails, and since I don't realise but I open atom as soon as the system finish boot, once I open up a terminal, bash automatically runs the script and try again to mount my working dir and all my files opened in Atom workspace get automatically saved and replaced with blank files.
**Please help me provide a better title and ask for more information if there is some need for a better understanding.**
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Enable autosave
2. Mount a drive
3. Open a file in the mounted folder
4. Enable the option for atom to save the workspace
5. Close atom
6. Unmount the drive
7. Open atom (Atom opens the file as blank, not finding it)
8. Mount the location

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]
The file gets reloaded as soon as the mounting point is available or you get prompted regarding that.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]
The file get replaced by atom automatically without options to reverting back (ctrl+z as example).

"470","Unfold tree (unfold everything under definition) feature","When I open a file, I first use the `Editor: Fold All` command to get a high-level view of the file, and then locate the function I want to look into. Now, to actually look at the code of that function I unfold the line where the function begins by clicking the little `>` arrow to it's left.

The problem is when functions contain other functions, then all the sub-functions are by default folded too. So to see the full code of the sub-function, I need to manually click and unfold each of them, and possibly the sub-sub-functions too. In a language like OCaml, where it's common coding practice to have many nested `let ... in` structures, this makes it a huge pain to use the folding feature.

**Suggested enhancement**

Instead of toggling between fold and unfold when clicking the arrow, instead cycle through ""fold"", ""unfold"", and ""unfold entire tree"".

**Current and suggested behavior**

Currently, after a fold-all, my code looks like this:

```
> def foo(n): ...
```

If I click the arrow once, I get:

```
 def foo(n):
>    def bar():...
>    def boo():...
```

And to see everything I need to click and unfold `bar` and `boo` manually. Clicking the arrow next to `foo` once more just returns it to the folded state in the first code block above.

Instead, I suggest that clicking the `foo` the second time produces this instead:

```
 def foo(n):
     def bar():
         pass
     def boo():
         pass
```

**Why would the enhancement be useful to most users**

It would save users of languages like Ocaml many clicks, and they'd be able to easily see the entire code of a function.

This feature exists in Emacs, for example, the default behaviour of <Tab> folding in org-mode does exactly this.

"474","Sanitize Config String Before Writing to config.cson","- Go to a package with at least one config field of type string. (for example, Ignored Name field in fuzzy-finder package)
- Try typing something like `#{ a }` to the string field
- Atom will display an error message saying that config.cson cannot be loaded. And configuration will not work anymore unless you go to the config.cson file and delete the error line manually.

This probably is because config.cson is treated as a regular coffee script file and `""#{ a }""` is treated as a coffee script string interpolation which translated to `""..."" + a + ""...""` in javascript. Since `a` is not presented in the scope, it causes the error.
I think sanitizing the string before writing to config.cson should make this problem go away.

"476","Error in gitbash with atom shell command not handling directories with spaces in Windows 10","### Description

Attempting to use the `atom .`  command was producing the following error in git bash. Running the atom command in the windows command prompt worked fine but gitbash gives the following error.

![Image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12580197/15162400/8ddc48c4-16b7-11e6-89f4-a030b70eb11f.PNG)
### Solution

I noticed that my user folder ""Terrell Big T Vest"" was being cut off at just ""Terrell"". I guess the shell command wasn't dealing with the space in the directory path. The solution that solved this issue just involved adding double quotes around a portion of the pushd command like so. 
#### Previous Code

[Link to specific line of code](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/f00ac5ca0a4c64f4f1b05c394ec4ecfb70fa59ff/resources/win/atom.sh#L2)

``` sh
pushd $(dirname ""$0"") > /dev/null
```
#### Solution Code

``` sh
pushd ""$(dirname ""$0"")"" > /dev/null
```
### Atom Version

1.7.3
### OS Version

Windows 10 version 1511 (OS build 10586.0)

**Expected behavior:** open folder in atom at directory of bash

**Actual behavior:** gave the error provided above via a screenshot and did not open atom.
### Additional Comments

Again, I tested the original code in the windows command prompt and everything works as expected. The original code also works on windows when the user folder does not contain any spaces.
Hopefully this change can be made to the atom.sh folder to prevent this issue with others who have a user folder that contains spaces.

"478","Atom fails to open new windows from command line","Atom Editor v1.7.3

I used to open new atom windows using:
`atom -n .`
A few months ago that quit working. Now, from the shell, atom only opens a window if atom is not already running.
I can still open a new window from inside the editor, but not from a shell.

Now, if I open the first atom instance in the foreground, with logging enables, ie, with
`atom -fnl`
I get a log of the error when I try to open another window from a different shell instance:

> I searched both open and closed issues for `UTI`, `public.plain-text`, and `""default text editor""` but nothing seemed relevant.

Happy to be corrected about any of this.
### Description

After installing Atom on my Mac, many files (especially those without extensions) still open in (shudder) TextEdit. I took a look in Atom's `Info.plist` file, and also used [duti](http://duti.org/duti.1.html) to check the list of handlers, and it appears that Atom doesn't register for the `public.plain-text` UTI. As a text editor, it really should register with OS X to handle the editing of text files.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install Atom v1.7.3 on OS X
2. Open a Terminal window
3. Type `touch MyAtomTestFile` and press return
4. Type `open MyAtomTestFile` and press return

**Expected behavior:** I expected the file to open in Atom

**Actual behavior:** The file opens in TextEdit (or perhaps another editor depending on what you have installed).

(You'll probably also want to `rm MyAtomTestFile`, too.)

### Description

Atom gets into a perplexing state for some people ([for example](https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-editor-width-bug/28439)) whether by some combination of keys or package actions where there is only one pane, but it does not take up the full width of the editor window. Atom should not be able to get into this state.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch Atom
2. Ensure there is only one pane in the window
3. Press <kbd>Cmd+Alt+-</kbd> multiple times

**Expected behavior:** Nothing to change

**Actual behavior:** The pane area for the single pane shrinks even though the window does not change size

"485","Package doesn't work correctly after update when something new is added to atom.config","### Description

I updated my package [language-markdown](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown) yesterday and I received the following issue report: https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/108

I haven't heard back from @MGallow yet, but I'm relatively certain that the issue is related to what I've mentioned in my initial response to the issue report. **The underlying issue** (I think): Whenever I add a new option to `atom.config` in an update, this causes the package to malfunction when it is updated.

I haven't experienced this issue on my development machine (because I think the new config item is already created during development), but I have seen it multiple times when updating on my secondary computer. Reloading Atom fixes the issue.
### Prerequisites
- I'm sure I can technically reproduce this, but it's quite the hassle. Each reproduction gives only a single opportunity to look at what's wrong. I'm also relatively certain (at least I hope so) my own code isn't the cause of these issues. See https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/blob/master/lib/main.coffee (L22-26 for config, L50-51 for subscriptions, and L166-180 for execution)

### Description

The title bar color (Windows 7 classic theme) does not always update and is sometimes grey (non focused window) while the window is focused and should be blue (focused window).

//cc @damieng Windows only issue?
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Classic mode windows (I don't know if needed I only use classic mode)
2. Open atom in safe mode.
3. Ctrl-shift-o and move the dialog over the blue title bar, title bar gets colored grey where the dialog was moved over. Other operations such as making a new snap in the snipping tool also changes the color of the title bar.

See example of title bar of focused application where open dialog was moved around.
![atom title bar color](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1058982/14931437/b8afb67a-0e6b-11e6-98a0-0082e3673450.png)

**Expected behavior:** Title bar color to update consistently as other windows applications and be completely blue when the application is focused.

**Actual behavior:** Title bar color is incorrect and depends on how some dialog was moved or other actions while having atom open.

"490","[Feature] Notification about update (instead of auto download + install)","I had to disable ""check for updates"" under Help > About because Atom would download updates over a roaming connection (wifi tethererd via phone). But now I have to remember to check for updates. Wouldn't it be better if it would still check for updates but give a notification for it when one is available?

The default behaviour could still be to automatically download and install them, but instead of a checkbox with ""Check for updates"" I'd rather see a ""Automatically download updates"" option and a notification if it isn't checked.

Or maybe this is an idea for a package? I have no experience with building those for atom so... uuhm.. I'd need help with that :)

"491","Filenames display with normalized spaces in tabs","Opening a file with multiple spaces in the filename displays as one space.

For example a filename with 2 or more spaces displays in the tab as one space:
""811347  1_por.xml""
displays as 
""811347 1_por.xml""

This screenshot shows two filenames where one has multiple spaces and one that has only one space. They look identical in the tabs title.

"492","Editor hangs forever when navigating to the end of a long line","### Description

When the cursor is at column 0 of the line after an extremely long line, and the left arrow key is pressed to move the cursor to the end of that line, Atom freezes forever.

Moreover upon relaunch, it reopens the SAME FILE to the SAME CURSOR POSITION and hangs again, meaning the user is stuck in a permanent hang-restart loop. Atom is reduced to an annoying emulator of DLL Hell.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Set Atom to open
2. Open a 200kB XML file, encoded in UTF-16 LE, that has all its text distributed on two lines.
3. Atom opens this file with your cursor at the top left.
4. Move the cursor to column 0 of the second line.
5. Press the left arrow key.
6. Atom wraps around and then hangs forever.

### Description

This would enable just adding an Error-Notification with an Error as parameter and probably saves some developers some seldom Exceptions complaining about the wrong data type of the message.

As a nifty Addon, the Notification could treat `err.stack` as the detail-option.

? ☕ 
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Deliver an (NodeJS) `Error`-object to `atom.notifications.addError()` as `message`-parameter.

**Expected behavior:** Atom should display the `Error.message` as `message` and `Error.stack` as `detail`.

**Actual behavior:** Atom raises an Exception:

```
Error: Notification must be created with string message: <...>

### Description

On Ubuntu, when opening a file from the file manager in Atom, it will first open a new window on the current workspace (A). Opening a second file opens in the same window in a new tab. This is expected.

After changing to a different workspace (B) in Ubuntu where no Atom window is present and then opening another file, the file will open in the Atom window present on the first workspace (A). However, the expected behavior is that the file is opened in a new window of Atom.

My notion of expected behavior is derived from what is done by Gedit, the default text editor on Ubuntu. It also seems more intuitive to me that the file is opened on the workspace I'm currently viewing, even if Atom is already present on a different workspace. This follows an idea of using different workspaces for different tasks.

Some might disagree with this suggestion, but I would still like to see this as an optional behavior because this issue is one of the most often mentioned by those I know who use Atom.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open a file in Atom from the file manager in Ubuntu on workspace (A).
2. Change workspace to workspace (B).
3. Open a second file in Atom from the file manager.

**Expected behavior:** Two Atom windows open, one on workspace (A) with the first file and one on workspace (B) with the second file.

**Actual behavior:** One Atom window opened on workspace (A) with both files.

1. Unsure, unfortunately.  Just started happening out of nowhere.  Perhaps it's because I haven't opened up this particular project since around the beginning of March, which I think is before the new state-store code was added?

### Description

'm a new user of Atom and Git. I've configured git to use Atom as its core editor. Mostly Atom works for me; and mostly, git works for me. Together, they aren't happy.

Atom is configured as the editor in this manner: git config --global core.editor ""'C:/users/[user]/appdata/local/atom/bin/atom.cmd' --new-window --wait""

I've also tried it without the ""--new-window"" flag, with no difference in result.

When I issue a ""git commit"" command, I get some form of the following, IF THERE'S NO CURRENT
INSTANCE OF ATOM:

```

error: There was a problem with the editor ''C:/users/[user]/appdata/local/atom/bin/atom.cmd' --new-window --wait'.

If there IS ALREADY a current instance of Atom, then instead I get this:

```
App load time: 815ms
error: There was a problem with the editor ''C:/users/[user]/appdata/local/atom/bin/atom.cmd' --new-window --wait'.
Please supply the message using either -m or -F option.
```

In neither case does the commit succeed.

I don't know whether the ""-m"" or ""-F"" option would solve the problem, but if it will I'm not sure how to supply one of those.

I've done very little configuration with git and Atom, so they're both very close to ""out of the box"" with regard to customization.

Can anyone help?

-boster
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure Atom as the default editor for git, in gitbash, with this line of code:

```
git config --global core.editor ""'C:/users/[user]/appdata/local/atom/bin/atom.cmd' --new-window --wait""
```
1. Commit a change to a repository

**Expected behavior:** 
I expect an Atom window to open with git commit details, and a place for me to enter a commit message. Upon closing this Atom window, I expect the commit to be executed and succeed.

**Actual behavior:** 
The Atom window does open, and I edit my message and close the window. But instead of executing the commit, the commit fails.

"501","Decompose ligatures when the cursor is in/beside them","### Description

I use FiraCode2 with ligature support in Atom, and for the most part it's very nice.

However, I find it very difficult to edit ligatures. For example, I often need to change <$> to <*> in Haskell, but Atom does not show where in the ligature the cursor is, and I often lose time erasing the wrong part of the ligature.
Similarly, I will often try to delete the space before an arrow -> , but I end up deleting the first dash - because the cursor is shown beside the ligature, even when its actual position is in the middle.

Ideally, when the cursor was at the edge of, or inside a ligature, it would be rendered not as the single character, but as the actual simple characters which make it up.

Is this possible? If it is not, consider this a request that it be added, or at least supported in a package.

Thanks!
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Set the font to FiraCode, HaskLig, or another ligature-supporting font
2. Enter a ligature, such as `->`
3. Move the cursor from one side to the ligature of the other

**Expected behavior:** The ligature is decomposed into its constituent characters, or the cursor is shown inside the ligature.

**Actual behavior:** The cursor remains to the right of the ligature.

### Description

The ""keep waiting"" dialog that appears when Atom becomes unresponsive blocks until it is closed, preventing Atom from ever becoming responsive again until ""keep waiting"" is selected.  This is because Atom is performing a synchronous call to `dialog.showMessageBox` instead of an async one.  In addition, there is no code in place to automatically close the dialog if/when Atom does regain responsiveness.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Get Atom into an unresponsive state and have the ""keep waiting"" dialog appear
2. Wait for Atom to become responsive again
3. :zzz:

Hi, pressing ctrl-c on an empty line, copies the whole line.  Which is fine, except it deletes what's on the clipboard which is incredibly annoying.  I'd select the line if I wanted it.

A work-around, from this merge: https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8025

"505","[Feature Request] When pressing Ctrl-Tab key, display a panel of tab list in MRU order for cycling","### Description

The MRU tab switching in 1.7 is great, however it would be even better to pop up a tabs list panel in MRU order when pressing `ctrl-tab`, so that I can choose which specific tab to go to by holding `ctrl` and pressing `tab` key. The current behaviour would just jump to the first tab in the MRU stack, which is fine but really doesn't cover the most of editing scenarios.

What I mean is something like this package does [enhanced-tabs](https://atom.io/packages/enhanced-tabs).

"509","Separate file type icon for Windows","In reference to #10818 I would like to see file associations in Windows taken a step further by differentiating Atom's associated files with distinct file type icons. As of 1.7 all associated files take Atom's default icon as its own. At the very least all associated files should have a generic file icon separate from Atom's stock icon.

Ideally all file type icons should be changeable depending on the file extension thus conveying a visual difference between for example a .txt and a .py by visual recognition; however, starting with a separate generic associated file type icon would be significantly better than what is in place as of 1.7.

An example of files associated with Atom 1.7 on Windows 10 desktop:

Since upgrading to v1.7.0, I'm no longer able to do this. I'm unsure if this is by design or just an honest bug (or even if the previous behaviour was a bug to begin with...)

Also, the scroll offset isn't preserved after reloading the window: it reverts back to the top of the document. This wasn't the case before.

### Description

It seems that the version of Electron bundled in Atom fails to report any data back on `stdout` when called as Node. `options.env.ELETRON_RUN_AS_NODE` is set (to `1`), but the `stdout` callbacks are never called. If you have Node installed on the machine and replace `process.execPath` with the path to Node everything works as expected (tested with Node v5.9.0).

This has been reported as an issue by users updating to v1.7.0 on the following linter plugins:
- `linter-jshint`
- `linter-htmlhint`
- `linter-csslint`
- Possibly `linter-bootlint` as well (Looks like this might just be user error)

Note that none of those linters have AppVeyor (Windows) CI testing configured.

The following Node based linters _are_ being tested on AppVeyor, but it turns out all of these are directly being `require`'d, and as such aren't being ran as an ""external"" Node process:
- linter-stylelint
- linter-js-yaml

`linter-eslint` is interesting in that it _is_ working, but it utilizes a worker process that is being created with [`child_process.fork()`](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/blob/v7.2.0/src/helpers.js#L15).

This _might_ be a duplicate of https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2887, is probably caused by https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9627, and might be related to https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11162.

If there is any further information or debugging information that would help please let me know. I'm almost always available as @arcanemagus on Atom's Slack instance if anything is needed.

@50Wliu, @joshaber, @joefitzgerald I'm tagging you three as it seems you have all worked on parts of the Electron update and might know more about how to further test this.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open Atom v1.7.0 or above
2. Use something that attempts to load a Node process (ie: BufferedNodeProcess, or more indirectly  [linter-jshint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-jshint))
3. Observe that the `stdout` callbacks are never called

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]

Calling a Node process works as expected

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]

The `stdout` callback is never called, so the process `stdout` never gets any data.

When scrolling to a position that is already visible with the `center` option set to `true` (as described [here](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.6.2/TextEditor#instance-scrollToBufferPosition)), no scrolling is performed.
### Steps to Reproduce

``` javascript
editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor() /* open a file with 100 lines */
editor.scrollToBufferPosition([50, 0]) /* scroll to line 50, line 52 is visible now */
editor.scrollToBufferPosition([52, 0], {center: true})

That the file is never corrupted after a power cycle or the corrupted file is restorable. An editort should **never** be alowed to have this behaviour. At the moment of the power cycle I was not saving, only typing.

-- I had updated another bug which looked similar to me (10774), but was asked to open a new issue.
### Description

While trying to save a file, which was moved from one directory to another, saw this error.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a file in a directory and open it for editing
2. While the file is open, go to the terminal and move the file to another directory
3. In Atom, open this file in a new tab and then try to save..see the ""ENOENT..."" error

Notes:
1. The file does seem to get saved.
2. I am working on a directory which is mounted remotely.

### Description

This is very likely a very low priority issue caused by a race condition in the deduper (@lee-dohm  theory) but it is possible (if you are fast enough) to open the same tab multiple times (I managed twice at least).
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open tab from tree view by clicking on it.
2. Immediately after step 1 press enter.
3. Observe you have 2 tabs of the same file open, in the case where pending pane items option is true you have the one pending tab and one confirmed tab, without pending pane items option you have 2 confirmed tabs.

For me this was easier at my work computer and with the first tab that i open in that atom window, as the first tab takes several seconds to load you have a bigger window to execute the 2nd step.
At home I can reproduce it but I have to try for a long time.

**Expected behavior:** Atom to switch to already open tab at all times.

**Actual behavior:** Atom opens multiple (at least 2 confirmed) tabs of the same file.

### Key Info

**OS:** Windows 10
**Pre-update version:** Atom 1.6.0
**Post-update version:** Atom 1.6.1
**Update method:** Auto-update

Spoken to @thomasjo in slack channel (Recommended posting here), opening files on my PC are fine, network drive issues, SAMBA mounted network drive in windows, no issues before this.

Coming back to work on Tuesday atom had auto-updated, I believe to 1.6.1. This caused issues where the application would hang for 30-40 seconds upon basically any action, maybe get as far as clicking a button for it to hang again.

As you can imagine, hard to develop anything! So I completely uninstalled everything, removed all traces from %appdata% and my user folder (.atom - This is backed up) - I reinstalled a fresh copy of 1.6.1 from the site, everything seemed to be working, until I added a project folder and opened a file... Blank. Nothing, Nada. Even stranger, if I then close atom, relaunch, close the file and undo the close tab, it has it's contents... But no other file does.

Again, after this I removed all traces again and installed 1.6.0 with no luck resolving the issue, followed by trying out the 1.7.0 beta 3.

### Description

On Windows, environment variable names are case-insensitive.

In Atom 1.7.0 for Windows, `process.env.PATH` is returning `undefined` if the path environment variable is defined as `Path` (it is then accessible as `process.env.Path` only).

In 1.6 the environment variable is accessible as both PATH and Path.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. On Windows, ensure your path environment variable (`%PATH%`) is defined as `Path` (not `PATH` as is customary on UNIX).
2. Launch Atom and open the dev console (ctrl+alt+I)
3. Evaluate `process.env.PATH`.

**Expected behavior:** `process.env.PATH` should return the contents of the Path environment variable, regardless of what case its name is spelled in (as in Atom 1.6).

**Actual behavior:** `process.env.PATH` evaluates to `undefined`. Only `process.env.Path` returns the proper contents of the environment variable.

### Description

I don't understand Arabic myself, and it's the first time working with a RTL language, but I'm experiencing some rendering issues with a specific text. I have the following SQL insert statement:

``` sql
INSERT INTO `dwp_terms` VALUES
  (19,'عين المدينة','3ayn-almadina',0);
```

Which renders incorrectly. It seems it might be a Webkit bug, but I'm not sure. It might also be that the text is ill formatted, but it seems to render correctly in Firefox and Apple Notes, albeit with the words in reverse. I've included a screenshot from Sublime Text 3 which seems to render as I expected.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Use the following piece of text as a template `(19,'','3ayn-almadina',0),`
2. Paste `عين المدينة` into the empty quotes
3. Incorrect rendering

I do not know if this applies to more RTL scripts, but I've been working with about 40 terms that were ""converted"" to `INSERT` statements, and this was the only one causing trouble.

**Expected behavior:** here rendered with Sublime Text 3 (however, seems to not render arabic correctly)

When I go into my Settings, there's an input box for ""Non Word Characters""; these characters define word boundaries. It seems to me that it would make sense for Soft Wrap to break lines at word boundaries instead of only at spaces.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Enable Soft Wrap (in the View menu)
2. Write a line of text that exceeds the width of the buffer, thus triggering soft wrap. The line should include some of the Non Word Characters: `/\()""':,.;<>~!@#$%^&*|+=[]{}?-`

**Expected behavior:** Line wraps at a word boundary.

**Actual behavior:** Lines wrap only at spaces.

"539","Atom not respecting Electron CLI switches","This is a follow on from [a discussion in Atom's Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-and-electron-cli-switches)

I'm using Atom 1.6, which is built on Electron 0.34.5. In the [Electron docs](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/v0.34.5/docs/tutorial/debugging-main-process.md) it mentions the `--debug` and `--debug-brk` switches.

Running `/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom --debug-brk=60131` hangs. Normally node processes print out that they're waiting for a listener before proceeding. Using `--debug` allows Atom to run, but as I'm running a test (`--dev --test`) I'd like the process to block so I can connect my debugger.

There may be other Electron switches that Atom also doesn't respect that I don't know of.

### Description

This issue came up [here](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui/pull/127).

Currently `atom-overlay`s overlap the rest of the UI. I think it's ok, but only as long as the current line is visible. If you scroll it ""out of sight"", it looks odd having the overlay still be shown.

A possible solution might be to try to detect when the current line is not visible and then hide the `atom-overlay`. I think autocomplete kinda already tries to do that by jumping to the top when scrolling down, but doesn't hide completely. And would be nice if it's part of the core behavior, so all packages would get it. Maybe with an option to opt-out if a package wants stay visible all the time.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open find + replace `cmd-f`
2. Have autocomplete enabled and type something to open the autocomplete overlay.
3. Scroll down until the current line is underneath the find + replace panel

**Expected behavior:**

The autocomplete overlay should disappear

**Actual behavior:**

It stays on top of the find + replace panel, even tough you can't see the current line anymore

### Description

I would like to be able to distinguish my Objective-C .h, .m, Markdown, and Swift (and any other programming/markup language) files from one another in the Finder when Atom is set to be the default app for opening these files. Currently all the files show the same Atom document icon. When files are set to be opened by Xcode by default the file icons are different based on their type. Additionally it would be nice if external packages could dictate different images for different file types.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Set Atom to be the default app for opening Objective-C and Swift files.
2. View file icons in Finder

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]

File icons are different based on the file type.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]

File icons are all the same Atom document icon.

"542","Add warnings for broken keymappings definitions","Atom seems to be missing any kind of warning when a certain class of mistakes slip into the `keymap.cson` file. For example:

``` cson
'atom-text-editor.vim-mode-plus:(.insert-mode)':
  'ctrl-w h': 'window:focus-pane-on-left'
  'ctrl-w l': 'window:focus-pane-on-right'
'atom-text-editor':
  'alt-k': 'editor:move-line-up'
  'alt-j': 'editor:move-line-down'
'atom-text-editor.vim-mode-plus:not(.insert-mode)':
  'tab': 'vim-mode-plus:move-to-pair'
  'y s': 'vim-mode-plus:surround'
  'y s w': 'vim-mode-plus:surround-word'
  'D s': 'vim-mode-plus:delete-surround'
  'c s': 'vim-mode-plus:change-surround'
  'D s': 'vim-mode-plus:delete-surround-any-pair'
  'c s': 'vim-mode-plus:change-surround-any-pair'
# ...
```

will fail to load any of the keybindings in the file. Can you spot why? I spent a considerable amount of time uninstalling, and reinstalling packages, and then adding parts of the `keymap.cson` file selectively in order to figure out that I had forgotten the `not` before the paranthesis.

This could have avoided by either having Atom either:
- report some sort of warning 
- or have Atom fail silently _only_ for the failing selector (hope that's the right term), instead of the whole file.

Now every time causes this error. ~~Pasting (or vim putting) a `\n` character is fine, though; it's the actual keypress that is triggering a (attempted) call to `patch.getChanges`.~~ (That seemed to be true for a while; no longer the case.)

It's now also happening with other characters; mostly space.

If a git repo has a missing submodule path (compared to what's set up in git), Atom throws assertion errors.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a git repo
2. Include a submodule
3. Delete the submodule path from your working tree, but don't really ""remove"" the submodule
4. Open the project directory in Atom

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]

A usable Atom

### Description

[Per some discussion on the Atom boards](https://discuss.atom.io/t/code-folding-close-bracket/9997) there's some concession that folded blocks of code can often be difficult to parse and work around.

Here are some examples of the current behavior and a suggested change to make the fold easier to parse.

``` js
// Example code
function () {
  console.log('Hello world.');
  console.log('How are you today?');
}

/*
 * How Atom currently handles folds within a given syntax
 */
// Folding the function - Atom (JavaScript syntax)
function () {...

/*
 * What I expect to happen to happen in a given syntax
 */
// Folding the function - Atom (Plain Text syntax)
function () {
}

// Folding the function - Sublime Text
function () {
}

// A one-line variation
function () {..}
```

And another example using HTML

``` html
<!-- Example code -->
<section>
  <p>Hello world.</p>
</section>

<!--
 How Atom currently handles folds within a given syntax
 -->
<!-- Folding the block - Atom (HTML syntax) -->
<section>...

<!--
 What I expect to happen to happen in a given syntax
 -->
<!-- Folding the block - Atom (Plain Text syntax) -->
<section>
</section>

<!-- Folding the block - Sublime Text -->
<section>
</section>

<!-- A one-line variation -->
<section>...</section>
```

The `Atom (Plain Text syntax)` and `Sublime Text` format is easier to parse because it's clear where the function/block starts and stops. It also makes wrapping a folded block with more code easier because you can see the beginning and end of the full statement.

The other problem with the current Atom folding method is indenting a folded function does not work properly.

**JavaScript Example**:
![Indenting folded JavaScript in Atom](https://zippy.gfycat.com/ExcellentMerryCoyote.gif)

**HTML Example**:
![Indenting folded HTML in Atom](https://zippy.gfycat.com/FarTenseAdeliepenguin.gif)

@lee-dohm suggested I provide some examples of other folds besides just the [1TBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS) style. I've noted some proposals:

**Stroustrup**:

``` c++
// Example
class Vector { 
  public:
      Vector(int s) :elem(new double[s]), sz(s) { }
      double& operator[](int i) { return elem[i]; }
      int size() { return sz; } 
  private:
      double elem[lowast];
      int sz;
};

// Expected
class Vector {
  public:...
  private:...
}
```

**Allman**:

``` js
// Example
while (x == y)
{
  something();
  somethingelse();
}

// Expected
while (x == y)
{
}
```
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch Atom
2. In the correct syntax (not just ""Plain Text""), write a multiline, indented function/block
3. Collapse block
4. (To replicate indentation issue) Indent the folded, one-line block

"551","Finding MarkerLayers after they are created","I'm looking to access the `MarkerLayer` created by another package in my own package. It appears that when `MarkerLayer`s are created, they are assigned an `id`, but there doesn't appear to be a way to find a specific `MarkerLayer` via its current `id` without knowing the `id`.

Can we get a way to access (non-default) `MarkerLayers` outside of our own packages once they are created?

### Description

The ""Line Height"" setting has a significant visual separation from the ""Font Size"" and ""Font Family"" settings when people will often want to change them in concert with each other:

<img width=""781"" alt=""move-line-height"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1038121/13764377/dfd58a56-ea0b-11e5-9de8-48d1c439da2f.png"">
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch Atom
2. Open Settings view with <kbd>Cmd+,</kbd> on OS X or <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd> on other platforms
3. Scroll down so ""Font Size"" and ""Line Height"" both appear in the same screen

**Expected behavior:** ""Line Height"" to immediately follow ""Font Size""

**Actual behavior:** Large visual separation (see picture above)

### Description

The `atom` module can no longer be required in a task created using the `Task` class. It breaks the `fuzzy-finder` as well as any other packages that uses core classes from that module (like the `Emitter` or the `Disposable` classes).

For instance, when running in safe mode, the `fuzzy-finder` package is failing with: 

```

I suspect this is a bug and was not an intended change, but if it was I may point out that this will likely break a lot of packages and should trigger a major version bump.

### Description

As initially reported in #10852 and fixed in #10927, but with `cmd-backtick` as keybinding, using a French keyboard layout (AZERTY). 
The command no longer cycles through the open Atom windows. 
I'm using a modified french layout to remove the backtick dead-key, but I have the same behaviour when using the original layout.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open several Atom windows
2. Use `cmd-backtick` to cycle through them

**Expected behavior:** It should cycle through the open windows.

**Actual behavior:** It stays on the current window.

### Description

Currently, I have one project (folder) that open views with a very limited width, see screenshots below (taken in SAFE MODE).
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open [my setup repo](https://github.com/MoOx/setup) (not sure if that's related to some local cache). **Note that this only happen in this folder** (from what I see), didn't find any other yet).
2. Open a new document (cmd+n) or about or settings page

**Expected behavior:** Normal (full) view width, with correct tab visibility

**Actual behavior:** View/tabs are not visible as they used to be

_Screenshots taken in safe mode_

Here is a detailed view. I don't see anything that might take some space here

Is there a way I can find some local cache about the opened folder to see if that can fix the issue?
**I previously installed nuclide**, so maybe that is related ?
This bug did not happened when I installed nuclide, but some days after, after I changed some nuclide  config. I disabled nuclide and a lot of plugin, reverted my atom config (from the one versionned in setup repo) and still have the issue in safe mode.

In the last week or so Atom has stopped working on my Windows 10 machine. I use the same packages/extensions as on my mac machine and that's working fine, so I don't think it's a package problem.

The Editor loads but appears blank. Once I resize the window the black editor screen appears along with the tabs of opened files from my last session/project. But nothing responds.
### Prerequisites
- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)
  Yes it happens in Safe Mode. Here's the output:

[http://resource-centre.net/files/atom-error.jpg](http://resource-centre.net/files/atom-error.jpg)
- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#update-to-the-latest-version)?
  Yes.
- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging)?
  I can't load any of the config screens, but the menus appear.
- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?
- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?
  I think so.
- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?
  Yes, different people have different causes/solutions.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. [First Step]
   Load Atom in Windows. 10
2. [Second Step]
   Nope that's it!
3. [and so on...]

**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]
The last project opens and I can get on with work.

**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]
The screen is blank until I resize it, then the tabs/editor appears but nothing's clickable and no menus work. They appear but clicking a menu item does nothing.

When they show up together, I got follow panels stacked and takes up too much space of my screen (Picture 1).

How about a panel layout manager like android studio does (Picture 2), make every panel has its proper place, the features include:
1. Stack panels in tabs.
2. Have at least left and right group of panel tabs (like android studio does in Picture 2).
3. Drag move for manually manage panel group.
4. Panel size, group ... should be saved across atom sessions.

"561","Identical folders are opened as separate projects on case-insensitive filesystems","### Description

On case-insensitive (but case-preserving) filesystems, opening a project by passing its folder to the `atom` command will not restore the project, if the path given has the wrong case.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a project in Atom with 1 folder (e.g. `~/Foo`).
2. Open some tabs in that project.
3. Close the window.
4. Reopen the project using the `atom` command with a name differing only in case (e.g. `atom ~/FOo`).

**Expected behavior:** Atom restores the previously open tabs for that project.

**Actual behavior:** Atom creates a brand-new project with the wrongly-cased root folder `CApe`, and does not restore the tabs from the original project.

### Description

Having an additional copy of a default-installed package in `~/.atom/packages` can cause hard-to-diagnose bugs:
- https://github.com/atom/git-diff/issues/85
- among others

Sometimes having an overridden version of a default-installed package is useful for Atom developers but it seems to be causing problems and frustration for unsuspecting regular users. The proposal here is to show an error notification on launch if Atom is not in Dev or Safe Mode. Something like:

I can't speak for other developers, but there've been numerous times when I've started working on something Atom-related, and I need to reopen the current project in dev mode. For instance, I'm working on a [language package](https://github.com/Alhadis/language-apl), so I need to see changes to pattern-matching expressions instantly... but stupid me keeps forgetting to open a project in dev-mode before I start working on it. Since I don't usually need to do that.
## What would be ace:

A shortcut under _""Open in Dev Mode...""_ called _""Reopen window in dev mode""_ (greyed out if already in dev-mode) that does exactly what that 25-byte sequence implies.

I understand this could be achieved with a package, but to be honest, this functionality feels too rudimentary to omit from Atom's core command-set.

"573","Building Atom Beta releases so they can be installed simultaneously, on the same machine, to stable releases","Hi,

I realize you's are probably getting sick of me by now, but I was wondering if there is some option one can pass to `script/build` or `script/grunt install` to build Atom beta with different installed file paths, so that Atom beta and Atom stable releases can be installed simultaneously on the same machine. See running `script/build && sudo script/grunt install` in the beta branch of this repo will install Atom in the standard file locations (that are also used by the stable releases of Atom) on Linux platforms, at least, as those used by stable Atom releases. So you will get `/usr/bin/atom`, `/usr/bin/apm`, _etc._ files installed at those exact locations, while the Debian and RPM packages provided by this repo for Atom beta releases will install the same files to `/usr/bin/atom-beta`, `/usr/bin/apm-beta`, _etc._ instead and let Atom stable releases use the aforementioned installed file locations (i.e., `/usr/bin/atom`, `/usr/bin/apm`, _etc._) for their installed files. 

This issue means that presently the `atom-editor` and `atom-editor-beta` PKGBUILDs in the Arch User Repository cannot be installed simultaneously, even though `atom-editor` and `atom-editor-beta-bin` can be installed simultaneously because `atom-editor-beta-bin` builds its package from the Debian binary provided for Atom beta releases. 

Thanks for your time,
Brenton

Notice how each image is replaced and I can't have more than one open. This happens regardless of whether I opened the files with a single click or double click, and regardless of whether I double click the tab after opening a file. In other words, I can't seem to open multiple image files currently. This is also seems to be true for other non-text files (e.g. zip archives). For text files, I can get the expected behavior by opening them with a double click.

Reading [this comment](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10959#issuecomment-188920474) by @BinaryMuse, it seems that this behavior might partially be expected. However, I believe users will expect the same behavior for text and non-text files, especially non-text files handled by core packages (e.g. image-view and archive-view). If this isn't something that should be handled in Atom core, I think we should update our packages and possibly warn other package authors about this change and tell them how exactly they should update their packages.

"575","Suggestion: ""Smart Tab"" behaviour","If somebody asked me to imagine a perfect world, it'd be one where coders used hard tabs for indentation, and spaces to align all code after a non-whitespace character.

While this world will never exist, it does illustrate a potentially useful addition to Atom: a fourth tab-type option, which I'm calling _""smart tab""_ for the purpose of this issue:

Basically, the editor switches between hard tabs for indentation and spaces depending on whether or not there's a non-whitespace character before the cursor.

### Description

Currently, the chromium `log_level` is not explicitly set. This means that the `log_level` is implicitly `0`, which is the most verbose setting. We should set [1] the `log_level` to a level [2] that suppresses INFO and WARNING messages, at a minimum.

[2] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/logging.h#292
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch atom from the terminal / command line
2. Observe messages like `[852:0224/093645:WARNING:accelerator_util.cc(118)] Invalid accelerator token: command` and `[2804:0224/093645:ERROR:renderer_main.cc(200)] Running without renderer sandbox`

**Expected behavior:** Show only meaningful log messages when atom is launched from the terminal or command line

### Description

When opening a few projects, Darwin or Atom run out of file descriptors.
### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open atom in safe mode (or not in safe mode), and Console.app to keep an eye on things
2. Open a few Node projects, containing node_modules folders so there are lots of files in the repos
3. Either you get `kernel: file: table is full` in Console.app or `ENFILE` errors in Atom

**Expected behavior:** Atom should only open the files that it needs, hard to imagine it needs so many that the kernel stutters.

**Actual behavior:** System becomes unstable, needed to reboot

### Description

When saving a file after the first time, Atom throws an UNKNOWN error:

```
Unable to save file 'C:\Users\username\Documents\GitHub\markdown-preview\lib\markdown-preview-view.coffee'
UNKNOWN: unknown error, open 'C:\Users\username\Documents\GitHub\markdown-preview\lib\markdown-preview-view.coffee'

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open file
2. Save for the first time
3. Save for the second time

**Expected behavior:** File to save successfully each time

**Actual behavior:** The file saves on the first time but on subsequent tries throws the above UNKNOWN error until the computer is restarted.  The backups of the original file get successfully created.

Additional info: After the initial save, it seems like Atom locks the file, and any other programs are unable to save either.  Notepad++ will error on attempting to save _until Atom is closed_, at which point it will be able to save the file.  This started happening Saturday.

Defining a fontsize of more than `100%` for a certain css scope, such as `.heading-1` results in several rendering issues:
- Displaced lines, resulting in overlaps.
- gutters and cursor height does not match the actual line size / font height
- Bigger fontsized lines don't _soft wrap_ properly

This is no new issue and it's possibly difficult to prevent, as a lot depends on measuring lines heights etc. and having different sized characters certainly won't make it easier.
Some issues, such as a displaced cursor have been fixed previously eg. via https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8811, but the above ones still exist, that's why I decided opening this issue to collect thoughts and to link connected issues here.
If those issues were nonexistant, some interesting/useful things would be possible in syntax themes.

"590","Update CI To Node 5.x","#9627 introduces Chrome 47 and Node 5.1.1. It would be nice to have CI match the node version bundled with Electron.

Given that:
- Electron bundles node
- Electron doesn't only use stable node, it tries to track v8
- Atom is comprised of Electron, core code, bundled packages, and npm modules
- apm is really just a wrapper around `npm`

Then I think we should formulate a strategy to:
- Try to lock in the same version of node in CI for core, bundled packages, and npm packages
- Try to use the same npm version bundled with the aforementioned version of node in apm
- When specifying node versions in CI, try to lock to the major / minor, but allow later patch versions (e.g. `~5.1.1`, as opposed to `5` or `^5.1.1`)

The goal of this would be to try to be somewhat deterministic in the builds, but this is somewhat dependent on the core Atom build servers being upgradeable, as releases are still generated there.

Doing this consistently would also have the side effect of allowing us to establish an `atom` babel preset, that can be used to slowly dial back the transforms required during transpilation as the version of node continues to progress and more ES6 functionality is bundled in.

i would to suggest to add a few improvements to the file deletion dialog.

**First:**
if deleting a bunch of files it gets hardly to read... so please put the filenames into a x/y scrollable area.

**Second:**
if I detect a ""wrong"" filename, i need to cancel the dialog, and search for it in the tree nav... and start deletion again... so please put checkboxes in front of the file name which allows to deselect a file to exclude it from deletion

**Third:**
Add a dialogtitle :) currently the dialog has a blank title bar... 

**Forth:**
The lightbulb indicates a hint... Add an exclamation mark which would indicate a dangerous operation, or a question mark that indicates its a question...

**Fifth:**
Don't switch phrasing... i start the operation with an option that's labelled ""delete"", i read delete in the dialog text, then i need to ""move it to trash"" instead of simple ""delete"" it. Name the button please ""Yes, delete"" or change wording on action and dialogs. Oh, and i'm about to delete the files... i am not currently deleting them if the dialog is displayed

"600","Feature Request: Open project from within Windows Libraries view","I just noticed that when attempting to open a project that also shares a location within a Windows Libraries location (Windows 7 in this case) a context menu option to open with Atom is not present when selecting within the directory area (blank space in the right pane). I'm fairly certain this is either something overlooked or possibly due to the way Windows treats these directories as symbolic links. Right clicking for the context menu option for a directory within the tree view for a project presents the ""Open with Atom"" context option, just within the right pane it does not.

"601","Moved/renamed files (via tree view) with open tabs not linked anymore after operation","If I have a file open in Atom that I want to rename/move, and use tree view to do this, the tabs of the files lose track of where the file source is, and continuing to edit in the file tab causes the old file to be re-created on save.

Is it possible to have tree view inform the tab package of the file rename/move somehow, so that the source of the tab is updated and we can keep editing the file?

Having to close the tab and reopen it for the new file seems a bit 1990's :)

Possibly related: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9875
Although I would not propose to close the file buffers, just point them to the right folder/files again.

Maybe this is not something that's normal/common in Windows apps, but on Mac it's pretty common. Any file that I'm editing, I can just move it around or rename it freely, and any app using the file will still have a pointer to the correct file location.

The space invisibles should not be rendered. That said I'd really like it if there was a way to insert soft tabs after indents and use hard tabs for indents, at first I thought this rendering issue was a feature improvement :P

"605","Alt + menu hotkey doesn't work, closes menu on Windows","When trying to save a file by hitting the key sequence: alt+f alt+s the menu closes and the file does not save.

In every other Windows application I tested, this works. This is done to compensate when typing alt+f s quickly, the release of the alt key does not register before the s key is pressed, or the user does not release it in time.

It is expected that opening the menu, then pressing the hotkey OR alt+hotkey should trigger the action, as this behavior is present in virtually every other Windows application.

"606","Restored window size set to maximized after exiting maximized","When I exit Atom and window state is restored, its size is remembered; so when I start Atom again, the window starts restored and remembers its size. However, when I exit Atom maximized, the restored window size is set to maximized size; so when I start Atom again, it start maximized and when I click restore, the window size remains just the same (maximized size).

Simply said, nonmaximized window is too often set to maximized size and is just too big to normaly drag around and I have to manually resize window to smaller size each time.

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Exit Atom maximized
2. Start Atom again and click ""restore window""
3. The window size is same as maximized

**Expected behavior:**

Restored window size should be remembered correctly, so you can actually restore window to its last size, not restore it to maximized size.

**Observed behavior:**

I am unable to test this on different OS than Windows 10. I think it's not Electron bug, since VS Code behaves correctly. The reason why this bothers me is that I can't just grab maximized window and drag it, because it's size is same as maximized (= just too big for dragging around screen).

"608","Graphical glitches that occur under Arch Linux","Hi,

I have noticed that Atom 1.4.3 (have not noticed this issue with earlier releases of Atom) keeps experiencing graphical glitches, wherein tab titles, the toolbar and file windows become invisible or otherwise visually obstructed. Now to be clear by ""file windows"" I mean the windows (under the tab handles) wherein the contents of the file being edited is shown and can be edited, if my terminology is incorrect please correct me so that in future I can use the correct terminology when reporting Atom issues. In case my explanation is unclear I have taken screenshots of these bugs. These bugs seem to be plugin-independent as running Atom in safe mode makes no difference to these bugs. 

In this first example, you can see the second tab is partially obstructed in its view from the glitch.

![](http://imgur.com/a9IO6Sn.png)

In this second example, you can see parts of the file window and the left and centre tabs obstructed in their view:

![](http://imgur.com/a31M6oZ.png)

I know that some things seem to trigger its appearance, like scrolling down on larger files, switching between presently-opened windows, _etc._ If you want to know how I installed Atom well I installed it from my own PKGBUILD (which builds the Atom package from source code not from a Debian or RPM binary) which you can find [here](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs/blob/master/atom-editor/PKGBUILD). I have observed this bug under two different desktop environments: Cinnamon and KDE Plasma 5 and with several different GTK themes. 

Oh and yes these bugs seem to be limited to just Atom. All other programs seem to be devoid of this bug.

"610","Proposal: API enhancement for editors with block decorations","I fiddled with the block decoration features to check how this would affect the minimap and as I suspected it completely breaks the sync between the two views.

The biggest concern I have for the moment is that there is no public API to get the height and the y position of a line with a block decoration attached. Since I guess these are quite costly operations that are already handled by the editor's view I would expect it to expose these informations publicly so that we don't need to traverse all the editor's layers and decorations to compute these values. 

Another approach would be to have two sets of scroll values, one that account for the decorations and one that doesn't. For instance with a block decoration of 100px height at one line, the first method would return a scroll height equal to the height of all lines + 100 and the other one would return the just the height of all lines. Same goes for the scroll position, the first one would returns the scroll as it's used in the view, the other one would return the scroll position ignoring the block decoration (clamping the value to the start/end y of the line depending on whether the block is displayed before or after the line).

A third possibility is to have a scroll position defined as a couple of value: the first visible line index and a position within the line (in the range 0-1). If we have access to the line y position and height through an API, we can compute the corresponding scroll top, or map this to any other type of grid and still be in complete sync with the editor.

Another concern for the minimap is that block decorations breaks the assumption that an editor's lines all fit on a predefined grid. It means that I can no longer use a ratio to transpose a line height and position and still get an integer value at the end - let say a line takes 17px in the editor, and 3px in the minimap, I can always assume that line 11 will be at y=30px in the minimap. Now with block decorations, a line can have an arbitrary height, which means that if I apply this ratio to get the line height I'll probably end up with a decimal value. And as the minimap is using a canvas, decimal values need to be avoided at all cost to preserve the crispness of the minimap render. To workaround that I would probably need to map every line heights from the editor to a rounded value more suited to the minimap. But same thing here, it would better if I could avoid traversing all the editor's lines to make this computations. 

How do you feel about this?

"611","atom is ignoring files that shouldn't be ignored","atom is ignoring files that begin with a `test_` for me on Mac. eg. `test_function.js`. These files are greyed out in the tree-view sidebar, and my linter isn't linting these files.

If i go to atom -> packages -> tree-view -> settings, and check ""hide VCS ignored files"", `test_function.js` disappears from tree-view side bar.

Neither the `.gitignore` in the repo nor my `~/.gitignore_global` has have anything that matches `test_*`. I ran git check-ignore in the working directory to see what rules git was applying from where.

```
$ git check-ignore -v *
<user>/.gitignore_global:7:**/_*    _tmp
.gitignore:1:node_modules/  node_modules

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Untracked files:
  (use ""git add <file>..."" to include in what will be committed)

    test_function.js
```

Curiously, git status _is_ tracking the same file.

It seems that there isn't anything that would cause `test_*` to be ignored by atom, yet it is. The effect seems to be global. I've tried adding similar files to other repos and viewing the directory structure in atom, and atom ignores them everywhere.

Is there anything else I can do to find a cause ?

My suggestion would be, in `Settings/Installed Packages`, for each installed and enabled package show the correspondent Atom Helper CPU usage.

It would be ok to have these numbers updated only when I first open Settings/Installed Packages, no need to have them update in real time.

Another viable option would be to assign names to Atom Helpers, so that I can see the offending package name by inspecting the Activity Monitor.
For example:

"613","Make OS X CFBundleIdentifier distinct between stable and beta channels","On OS X, Atom.app and Atom Beta.app should have different `CFBundleIdentifier`s set in their respective `Info.plist`. Doing so would allow both ""Atom"" and ""Atom Beta"" to appear in OS X's Launchpad, among other benefits.

**Current behavior**

The [beta download page](https://atom.io/beta) claims users can have stable channel releases and beta channel releases installed side-by-side. However, both have the same `CFBundleIdentifier` value set in their `Info.plist` file: `com.github.atom`. Because of this, even though the two releases have distinct file names (`Atom.app`, `Atom Beta.app`), parts of OS X can't differentiate between the two apps. 

In particular, only one of the two apps will ever show up in OS X's Launchpad (among other oddities relating to opening files from Finder, setting default file associations, and so on).

**Suggested behavior**

Beta channel releases should have a `CFBundleIdentifier` distinct from stable channel releases, e.g. `com.github.atom-beta`. (It might also be useful to change the identifiers of bundled apps, like `Atom Helper.app`, but I can't personally speak to this one way or another.)

When I manually made this change, I saw both ""Atom"" and ""Atom Beta"" appear in Launchpad simultaneously. Both apps seemed to function properly on my cursory checking.

I was thinking this for markdown-like plugins, then I thought a general plugin could be more useful, also for html/xml editing.

"624","Temp files are created on Samba shares that aren't deleted on close, can't be deleted manually, and are only deleted upon unmounting the share","Atom 1.4.0 on OS X 10.10.5.  The Samba share is on Windows 7 SP1.

I didn't see this behavior in 1.3.x.

Repro:
1.  Edit a plain text file on a Samba share.
2.  (Atom creates a `.tmp` file in the same directory.  Sometimes.  Not always.  I don't know the repro steps to force it to do so.  ""Back Up Before Saving"" is off, so this must be some kind of special temp file.)
3.  Close the tab for the plain text file.  Temp file isn't deleted.
4.  Close Atom.

Expected:

Atom deletes the temp file.

Actual:

Atom doesn't delete the temp file.  The file can't be deleted either via Finder in OS X or via Windows Explorer on the Windows box where the Samba share resides.

Finder gives the error ""The operation can’t be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code -8072).""

Windows Explorer says that the deletion can't complete without administrative rights and shows the elevation dialog.  Elevating doesn't help: another dialog is displayed saying that the file can't be deleted.  (I didn't capture the exact error text of the dialog.)  Attempting to take ownership of the file via `takeown` and modifying its ACLs via `icacls` fail:

```
> takeown /s MYBOXNAME /u MYBOXNAME\MyUsername /f . /r

WARNING: User credentials cannot be used for local connections.
ERROR: The current logged on user does not have ownership privileges on
       the file (or folder) ""E:\work\current"".

processed file: .
processed file: .\notes.txt
.\notes.txt~RF449e304.TMP: Access is denied.
Successfully processed 2 files; Failed processing 1 files

>
```

`handles.exe` v3.46 (a Sysinternals tool by Mark Russinovich) shows that System has open handles on the temp file.

The temp file only gets deleted when the Samba share is unmounted from OS X.

Multiple temp files may be created, so reference above to ""the temp file"" are also applicable to ""the temp files"".  Again, I'm not sure under what circumstances Atom creates them, but the end result is that heavy Atom work on a Samba share leaves un-deletable temp files scattered about which screw up directory diffs, syncing directories, moving things around, uploading directories to other places, deleting directories that are no longer needed, recursively adding directories to source control, etc. etc. etc., and force an unmount and remount to resolve.

This is a fairly recent regression, as the commands worked properly in 1.3.x.

FWIW, #7662 - ""ctrl-delete does not remove CRLF"" - was closed after PR https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9937 landed in early December 2015.  That change was released with 1.4.0-beta0.  I haven't done a `git bisect` - but that could potentially be a place to start looking.

That's not too much of a problem.

However, if you open a directory as a project from the command line with the last part of the path as a `..`, then it gets a bit messier. Running

`atom.exe C:\Users\Mark\Desktop\ProjectFolder\SubFolder\..\`

Opens the `ProjectFolder` as a project, but with the title "".."", which isn't so nice.

Could atom check for this and resolve the path/folder name?

A usage case for this is a software project where you want to launch Atom from another the IDE which makes the IDE project path (for instance in the source sub-directory) available as a parameter, but you want to launch the folder above (which contains the documentation directory and source directory) in Atom.

2. Open different files in each window.
3. Close Atom with `cmd + q`.
4. Restore Atom from the Dock/Finder. Both windows will have the state of one of the previous windows; the other is permanently lost.

I understand this is due to the way Atom saves project state - it appears to be based off a hash of the set of working directories (which is recorded in `~/.atom/storage/application.json`).

I don't have a great proposal about how to fix this; perhaps in the case of multiple windows the hash could include the window index? It seems to be a fairly uncommon use case, anyhow.

Double-click and hold on the word `multiple` - this will select the word `multiple` and as expected enter a ""per-word"" selection drag.  Move the mouse to the right and the word `words` will be correctly selected all at once.  However, it is impossible to add the `;` to the selection without the `)`.  This is different behavior than you would see in some other text editors, including emacs and Mac OS default input fields.

"652","OSX: Inconsistent cmd+D behavior","**Operating system**: OSX El Capitan v10.11.2 (15C50)
**Atom**: v1.3.2

**Description of problem**:

`cmd+D` does not always work as intended. The expected behavior is that it selects the next instance of the highlighted occurrence. For instance, if `sandwiches` is selected, and `cmd+D` is entered, then the next instance of `sandwiches` should be selected. There should be no circumstance where any text aside from `sandwiches` become highlighted after typing `cmd+D`.

Sometimes – seemingly when `D` is pressed too quickly after pressing `cmd` – Atom gets confused and highlights _up until_ the next instance of the text.

**Steps to reproduce:**

**Update: [Follow the steps here](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10312#issuecomment-170034796)**
# 

Here are some screenshots:

**Expected behavior**

To reproduce these screenshots, press `cmd` and then `d` with at least 100ms of timing between them.

Image 1: this is after pressing `cmd+D` once:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2322305/12161839/ac9c2d48-b4c8-11e5-891c-3ceb684ef8f0.png)

**Unexpected behavior**

To reproduce these screenshots, type `cmd` and then `D` very quickly. A non-scientific guess is to try to get it down to ~5ms between them.

Image 1: this is after pressing `cmd+D` once:

Is this a bug, or is it intention behavior where it functions differently when the keys are pressed too closely together? I've used Sublime Text for years, and I use this hotkey so frequently that I type it very, very quickly; ST behaves the same way whether there's an appreciable delay or not.

"664","Enhancement suggestion: Make non-printing control-character (etc.) constants visible","1. I don't know if this Enhancement Suggestion belongs in atom/atom or in atom/language-ruby.  I do suspect that this enhancement also applies to other languages such as Python, Perl, etc., not exclusively to Ruby; given its display-oriented nature, it does seem (to me) to be Atom/core rather than syntax/language- (Ruby-) dependent.
2. See attached screenshots for comparison between what Sublime Text 3 does and what Atom does not yet do... but should.  These two screenshots show exactly the same file/lines of code in both Atom and in Sublime Text.  The Atom screenshot was taken in v1.1, but the same behavior exists in v1.3 (my current Atom).
3. In Ruby (also in other languages), a constant (or variable) can be declared as at Line 31 (in both screenshots), for example a constant ESC (an ""Escape"" character code) which has a single character code (integer) value.  Other instances of this sort of thing would include CSI (Control Sequence Introducer), SI (Shift-In), SO (Shift-Out) char-code values, etc.

Once declared, Sublime Text will render a graphic, e.g., a reverse-video'd ""ESC"" wherever that character-code value occurs in subsequent character strings... Atom does not.

See Lines 32--59 for the Sublime Text screenshot, which clearly shows ""ANSI Escape Sequence"" strings of characters (including in comments!) -- the corresponding lines in the Atom screenshot do not, thus implying that these ""ANSI Escape Sequence"" characters strings are malformed and missing the leading ESC character.
1. Suggestion/request is to enhance Atom (or syntax/language packages, especially Ruby) to recognize such character-code constants (&/or variables) and render them visibly as part(s) of character strings where these occur (mimicking Sublime Text in this regard).
2. My environment/versions:
   $ atom -v

Bizarrely, if the original window is split with `Cmd+K, right` on that exact tab, opening it in another pane, and that second view is dragged into a new window, then this works (even though dragging the split tab back into the first pane hilariously [crashes](10109) atom).

"679","Quitting and re-opening Atom does not save the same tabs I had open","Whenever I quit Atom and re-open it, the same 3 tabs from something I was working on 6 months ago always open and _not_ the thing I was just working on.

I have uninstalled and installed the `save-session` package multiple times, no luck.

This is version 1.3.1.

I'm guessing some file somewhere has these 3 files of mine saved and this file just never gets updated?
","bug"
"680","Atom hangs on opening multiple same name files with similar paths","When trying to open multiple files with the same name but under slightly different paths, atom crashes.

**Reproduction Steps:**

**1**. Create the following folder and file structure outside of Atom. Files do not need to have any content.

```
root/
      folder1/ 
             sub1/
                  file.txt
             sub2/
                  file.txt
      folder2/ 
             sub1/
                  file.txt
             sub2/
                  file.txt
```

**2**. Open the folder `root` in Atom using File -> Open Folder
**3**. Open any three files by clicking on them in the Tree View

**Expected behavior:**
Atom opens up all three files in their own tabs

**Observed behavior:**
Atom editor stops responding on trying to open the third file, a few seconds later a dialog pops up asking to wait or close. Wait never resolves so closing is the only cause of action. The developer console shows no exception.

**Atom version:** 1.3.1
**OS and version:** Windows 7

**Installed packages:**
None

**Additional information:**
This bug occurs on a fresh install of atom with zero config changes or package installs.
I believe this has something to do with how the tabs are named with files that have the same name. 
When opening two files you get one of the following tab names
- `folder1\...\file.txt` | `folder2\...\file.txt`
- `sub1\file.txt` | `sub2\file.txt`

However when you open a third file, Atom doesn't know how to name the 3rd tab because if it tries to follow one of the formats above, it will have two files that have identical tab names. e.g.

`folder1\...\file.txt` (Meaning folder1\sub1\file.txt) | `folder2\...\file.txt` (Meaning folder2\sub1\file.txt) | `folder1\...\file.txt` (Meaning folder1\sub**2**\file.txt)
- Problem can be reproduced in safe mode: **Yes**
- Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Atom: **Yes**
  - Can't reproduce this problem in 1.2.3 Windows 7 or 1.2.0 Linux Debian. It's worth noting that 1.2 formats the tab names differently (`file.txt - folder1\sub1`)
- Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: **Yes**
- Problem happens with all files and projects, not only some files or projects: **Yes**

"682","Atom freezes with split panes on OS X","To reproduce:

``` sh
$ mkdir -p atom_test/{lib,test}
$ cd atom_test
$ touch lib/transport.js test/transport.js
```

Add some content to the two files. Open one of the files and then split the pane vertically. After splitting the panes, atom freezes and requests to close. 

It only seems to happen if the filename is the same, but they are in different directories. (`test/transport.js` and `lib/transport.js`)

What is really weird is that it just started doing it out of the blue. I have tried removing ~/.atom/storage and it still does not work.

"683","Scrollbars can't be styled without making them visible the whole time","It sounds funny, I know. But it looks like it's currently not possible to style the editor's scrollbars without making them visible the whole time. Just try it: Add some stylings to your theme's stylesheet and suddenly the scrollbars will be visible the whole time.

I've tried it, too. If you want to see an example, just clone [material-ui](https://github.com/leo/material-ui/blob/master/styles/atom.less) and comment out the last few lines. Usually, this should just change the look of the scrollbars. But what it really does is making the scrollbars visible the whole time (independed from your OS' settings).

I also haven't yet seen a theme that managed to style them without making them visible the whole time. Would be awesome if this could be fixed! :see_no_evil:

"695","Inconsistent file formatting for exceptions on Windows","I noticed while running specs that the way that there's absolutely no consistency in how the file is displayed in exceptions (eg the `at file:line:column` display)

Examples:
- `C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\atom\spec\text-editor-component-spec.js` - Expected, this seems to be super rare though :frowning: 
- `file:///C:/Users/user/Documents/GitHub/atom/spec/project-spec.coffee` - Acceptable, much more common
- `C:/Users/user/Documents/GitHub/atom/spec/text-editor-component-spec.js` - Technically not correct.  This only seems to appear when the file isn't wrapped in parentheses (so it also doesn't have a function associated with it).  Probably just forgetting to relativize the path.
- `file:\C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\atom\spec\config-spec.coffee` - ..._what_?  Seems to be the most common too :worried:.  I'm going to take a quick guess and say that the relativizing of paths is just converting `/` to `\`, leading to `file:\\\C` which is escaped to `file:\C`.
- `/C:/Users/user/Documents/GitHub/atom/src/buffered-process.coffee` - Definitely not correct.  This only occurs in custom logging, for example the config and deserializer validation (`source: /C:/file (line)`).  No idea what's happening here.

In addition, outside of specs, there's also a lot of inconsistency:  most exceptions will thankfully be either of the form `C:\` or `file:///C:/` though.  However, the `/C:/` version is displayed for errors from `init.coffee` (`At /C:/Users/user/.atom/init.coffee:4`).  The actual stacktrace contains the `file:///` version though: `at atom-text-editor.atom.commands.add.custom:trigger-error (file:///C:/Users/user/.atom/init.coffee:17:2)`.

Only the `C:\` and `file:///C:/` versions are properly caught by the Notifications package.

I guess, this is desired behaviour. (Alternatively, the buffer could stay open and internally change the file it is referring to, but this is another topic.)

However, the behaviour is different when instead of a file a whole folder is moved (via drag and drop) in the Tree View: Buffers of files in the folder stay open, and upon closing them manually, a dialogue ""file.xyz has changes, do you want to save them?"" is triggered. This is certainly not good behaviour. The buffers should be closed instead.

Furthermore, if the file is not yet added to git, it is marked green in the Tree View, along with all higher level folders. If now a folder with such a new file is moved, the green marking does not update properly for the higher level folders.

"703","OnDidChange TextEvent values not set correctly upon single newline character.","### Reproduce:

Subscribe to the TextEditor OnDidChange event and simply output the TextEvent object to the console log.
Enter a newline into a new text buffer in the UI (Hit Enter/Return) to fire off the OnDidChange event.
Examine the logged console object:
1. The TextEvent object field 'newText' does not include the newline character, it is an empty String.
2. The oldRange values are incorrect for the end/start fields.  They show the same position as the newRange.

Compare this to a backspace/delete that removes the newline and moves the cursor up one row.
The TextEvent object field 'oldText' includes the newline character that was deleted.
I think the two operations should be inverses, and the values of oldText/newText fields mirrors of each other in either situation at the very least.

_Update:_
The TextEvent does fire, but an additional TextEvent with invalid information also occurs.

**Atom Version:** 1.2.4
**System:** Ubuntu 14.04.3
### Done When:

The additional event that describes no change (newText and oldText both empty Strings) does not occur.

"705","Crashes or hangs when reloading large file","I have a large file (11,266 lines) that's being generated from a code generation script.  If I leave that file open in Atom and regenerate the code, which is done by redirecting stdout from a Python script, Atom will regularly hang or outright crash.  Sometimes you can do this a half dozen times, other times it will hang or crash on the first rewrite of the file.

Expected behavior is to refresh and reload the file in Atom.

As seen in Atom 1.0.6 and 1.2.4 on Ubuntu 15.04.  Happens in safe mode as well.

Also reproducible in OSX with Atom 1.2.2 and 1.2.4.  Will be attaching the crash logs from Console.app shortly.

How I can reliably reproduce the bug (requires Python 2.7, `pip install html2text`):

From the https://github.com/DualSpark/rusoto/tree/feature-better-s3-codegen branch, run: 

``` bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

``` bash
cd codegen
./botocore_parser_s3.py botocore/botocore/data/s3/2006-03-01/service-2.json S3Client > s3.rs
```

That generates the code.  Now, open `codegen/s3.rs` in Atom and re-run the `./botocore_parser_s3.py botocore/botocore/data/s3/2006-03-01/service-2.json S3Client > s3.rs` command.  Atom will hang reloading the file, or crash outright.  If it doesn't crash or hang, running the command a few more times will cause a hang or crash.  Once or twice for Ubuntu, four to five times for OSX.

"720","No longer possible for package to have a pane item deserialized along text editors","Actually it works on 1.2.1 but is broken on beta.

In [tablr](https://github.com/abe33/atom-tablr) I have made my CSV editor class serializable so that quitting Atom with a csv editor open restores it on the next run. For that purpose I have a method on my package main module that loads all the models and views required to make that possible and registers the deserializers as soon as the package is loaded: 

![tablr_coffee_-__users_c_nehemie_github_tablr_-_atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/247140/11245265/19604b86-8e12-11e5-9f94-06a1fe0ec839.png)

However, as you can see below, when reloading Atom with my table editor open, it first tries to deserialize the object, and then loads the package:

Is it a regression? Or was it decided to remove this feature?

"723","Problem With Horizontal Scroll in Specific Condition","I have created a file to replicate this problem here:
https://gist.github.com/mssio/2e559b6d53de7a2e2438

Before you copy the content of the files in Atom please make sure that the width of your atom window is not super wide (can't display more than 150 chars) and the height of your atom window is not super tall (can't display more than 60 lines). Also make sure that the atom configuration on soft wrap is turned off.

After you copy the file you can see on line 1, everything is normal, you can use horizontal scroll and continue typing on line 1 and automatically scrolled to follow the cursor. But let's try to see the line 105, in that line we can't do a horizontal scroll and if I type on that line, the window will not follow the cursor.

This is really annoying problem because a lot of my code have a format like this and when I am in the middle / bottom, I will not be able to edit the code using Atom. I have to switch to another text editor.

I hope this is not a duplicate issue, please just close it if it is a duplicate. And I am sorry for my bad English.

"724","bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor counts tabs as spaces","I tried to call editor.bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor("".string"") to get range of currently selected string. Then I tried to get that string by calling editor.getTextInBufferRange(range). It works as expected and I get entire string if line is indented with spaces.

If line is indented with tabs, returned string starts several characters to the right, it is the right length (or cropped if there are no more characters). bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor seems to be counting single tab as multiple characters (based on its width), while getTextInBufferRange counts tab as only one character.

For example, if line starts with 2 tabs (4 chars wide) immediately followed by string, start column of range returned from bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor is 8 (or undefined, see below). Since getTextInBufferRange counts tab as one character, it returns string starting with eighth character which is already 6 letters inside of string I was trying to get.

Let's assume this code:

```
range = editor.bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor("".string"")
editor.getTextInBufferRange(range)
```

and this input:

```
\t\t""my string"", some other text
```

If cursor is placed before ""r"", bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor returns undefined. That is because editor.getCursorBufferPosition (used internally by bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor) counts tab as one character and therefore it returns column < 8, which as far as bufferRangeForScopeAtPosition (also used internally by bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor) is concerned is not within any string.

If cursor is placed after ""r"", it returns ""ring"", some"".

When you look at tokenizedLines in TokenizedBuffer for that line, you see that tags start [4,4,...] (4 may be replaced by actual tab width) and as far as I can currently tell this seems to be the problem. I assume that either tokenizer should not count tabs as multiple characters or bufferRangeForScopeAtPosition should not take tags as buffer column numbers.

Notice how the markers somehow translate from line to line as the top edge of the editor scrolls over the line with the marker (I'm only _guessing_ this is marker related since it can be reproduced with both spellcheck lines and find-and-replace selections, I haven't investigated this further).

I was able to reproduce this with a bunch of lorem ipsum snippets wrapped to 80 chars (notice the top line which has double spellcheck lines):

"731","Atom hangs when docked to left or right side of screen - Windows","After moving Atom to the left side of my screen using windows shortcut (Win+left arrow key) or (Win+right arrow key), Atom hangs. However, when I move it around or make it full screen. Atom starts to work again.

I've tried this in safe mode and I experience the same problem.

Edit: I've found an easy way to reproduce it somewhat consistently. If you open one atom instance and move it to the right or left side and then open a second atom instance and move it to the other side. The second atom instance will hang. As shown in the picture below.

"732","Portable 1.3b0 on Windows uses sibling folder for config","When using the new --portable command line param, my .atom folder is moved to be a sibling of my Atom folder.  I was expecting to see .atom appear within that folder (as a sibling to the executable) and it took me a while to figure out why I didn't see it there.

Would it be possible to make that change?  I think a lot of folks take 'portable' to mean that they can drag a single folder to a new destination and a hidden sibling folder complicates that.

"736","Rebuild packages fails in Beta","Similar to https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8837, however this only happens with the Atom Beta build, no _Incompatible Package_ issues in stable build.

Upon opening Atom, even in safe mode, a red bug icon appears. The screen it leads to reveals that

> Some installed packages could not be loaded because they contain native modules that were compiled for earlier version of Atom.

Clicking the button to `Rebuild Packages` fails giving the errors shown below.
Note the target path for the Make command is odd and seems to point to the non-beta version.
`../../../../../../../../../../../../Applications/Atom`

If i navigate to the package folder and run the rebuild command, it succeeds with `apm` but fails with `ape-beta` giving same output as above.

"738","When opening multiple files Atom (1.3.0.beta0) creates a new window for each file","In Atom 1.2.0 when I opened a lot of files at once from the finder it was just adding them to a previously opened window. Now I'm trying the version 1.3.0.beta0 and it created a new window for each file, each of them having the folder the file was into as the project folder.

This is the result:

1. Install atom-ide-ui package
2. Open the diagnostics pane
3. Switch from One Light to One Dark or vice-versa
4. Observe wrong color for table column header

Actual part of the css is

.nuclide-ui-table-header {
  font-weight: bold;
  background-color: @pane-item-background-color;
  border-bottom: 1px solid @base-border-color;

```

Where `@pane-item-background-color` is still resolving to the old value.

### UI theme

This can especially be seen when switching from white to black themes or reverse:
![themeswitching](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11966684/11130908/f63e6bf8-8987-11e5-9162-00a59b8124d8.PNG)

When restarting Atom the theme is correctly applied. However at least one package also often ignores a restart and show the wrong colour. This is:
- editor-stats as reported [here](https://github.com/atom/editor-stats/issues/28) already previously where this issue only was about this single addon

And FYI when switching back to the theme you switched from everything is displayed normally (or as before you switched - `editor-stats` still looks like it looked always)

This is similar to the issue https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8860 which was fixed before, but Atom does not show any warnings in the developer console.
### Syntax theme

I can also see this happening with the sytax theme. However here it only applies to `markdown-preview` (same issues as above; works when restarting Atom) and the editor seems to be changed correctly.
However when looking more carefully even here sometimes it does also not correctly change the font colour of a file (reproduced with a markdown file). When switching to a dark syntax theme the text stays grew. In this case also the global font setting is not applied correctly and does not change the font (note that it was correctly applied to a file opened after changing the theme).

One time it also did not changed the colour of the line numbers:
![linenumbers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11966684/11131689/2eeb2c6c-898c-11e5-9bf6-56956492bb67.PNG)

But when you switch to other desktop, and then switch to Atom again, the cursor is not a text cursor. Even clicking on the text again doesn't change that. The only workaround is to move the cursor to some other widget, and then move it over text area again.

"762","Atom incorrectly detecting changes to files with changed line endings when git has core.autocrlf set","I'm having an issue where git on the command line doesn't report a file as changed, but Atom is showing the file as changed in the tree view.

Opening the file shows +22, -22 in the stats indicator in Atom, but doesn't show any individual line in the file as changed. (There are no bars indicating changed lines on the left.) If I change the file, the changed lines are shown as changed in the bars on the left, but no other lines in the file are shown as changed (as the stats indicator would have you believe).

Showing hidden characters lets me see that the line endings in the file are indeed different, but these changes are ignored by git, as per my settings.

Now here's something weird I discovered in the process of debugging this issue. This might actually be a bug in git...

``` text
$ git config core.autocrlf
input
$ git config --global core.autocrlf
$ git config --local core.autocrlf
$ git config --system core.autocrlf
```

git seems to think my `core.autocrlf` setting is set to ""input"", but I don't have it set to that anywhere in my settings. Why? I have no idea. Anyone know if this is a bug in git? And if so, where do I report it?

Setting `core.autocrlf` explicitly seems to resolve the inconsistency, causing Atom to once again ignore changes to line endings:

``` text
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

This difference of behavior is confusing though. Is this a bug in Atom? Or perhaps a bug in git, git-utils, or maybe libgit2?

Note I'm running `git version 2.6.2.windows.1` on Windows 10, and Atom v1.1.0.

Starting from the extreme left, I would expect a right arrow either to move the cursor to the next visual position (that is, between the ת and the ף) or jump to what is the next logical position (between the כ and the ת). Instead Atom doesn't move the cursor at all. Functionally however, it has moved between the כ and the dagesh (middle dot), similarly if I hit the right arrow again, the cursor stays at point 0 but logically it is now between the qamets (the vowel point beneath the כ) and the dagesh.

This gets interesting when you hit the right arrow a third time. The cursor now moves between the ת and the ף but logically it is actually between the כ and the ת and if you hit backspace, it will remove the qamets).

"782","Weird scrollbar behavior on OS X","It almost seems as if the hide/show logic for the scrollbars is inverted somehow; initially when loading Atom, no scrollbar is visible (as expected), upon scrolling no bar shows up.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Build Atom from master (also present in beta).
2. Open some file that allows scrolling, but do not scroll. Verify that there's no scrollbar visible.
3. Begin scrolling. Most likely no scrollbar will appear, but when you stop scrolling, one will likely appear.
4. Scroll once more and the scrollbar (if visible) will most likely go away.
5. Repeat ad infinitum.

I have the `editor.scrollPastEnd` option set to `true`, and running OS X 10.11.1.

I'm also experiencing scenarios when it doesn't show up at all.

"784","File auto reloading with untracked git files during branch change","Firstly:
Atom 1.0.19
Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS

The file buffer autoloading fails to load changes from `git stash pop`s on files that didn't exist in the previous branch you were on.  That's kind of a confusing sentence so I'll elaborate.  In this repo https://github.com/acb/Atom-Test there is a branch `master` with the file `master.txt` in it.  There is also a branch `dev` that has a file `dev.txt` in it that does not exist in `master`.

Now perform the following steps (leaving `dev.txt` open in Atom the entire time):
1. `git checkout dev`
2. Alter `dev.txt` in some way
3. `git stash` -- changes in `dev.txt` are stashed and the buffer in Atom changes appropriately
4. `git checkout master`
5. `git checkout dev`
6. `git stash pop` -- changes in `dev.txt` are `pop`ped to disk, but the buffer in Atom **does not** update

No errors are shown in the console.

If this goes undected by the user they could accidentally save `dev.txt` and blow away their stashed changes without any warning.  The solution as of now is to close the file (and DON'T SAVE CHANGES when prompted) and reopen.  In Sublime Text in this situation you get a prompt stating that the file changed on disk and asking you if you would like to reload.

Attached is a gif of the behavior.  Please let me know if I can provide any more information, and feel free to use the repo linked above for any testing you may need.

https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/1fdf2b98/pkg/nuclide/ui/atom-text-editor/lib/ReadOnlyTextEditor.js
1. This is pretty hacky and tough to maintain because it's hard to be sure that we have blocked off all reasonable entry points that could mutate things.
2. Currently on master, the new refactoring of `TextEditor` that frowns on using the constructor directly and strongly pushes for the use of `atom.workspace.buildTextEditor()` breaks our existing use of `extends TextEditor` in implementing `ReadOnlyTextEditor`.

We can work around this using a new hack (will link once the diff is up), but it would be nice to have proper support for this in Atom. We use `TextEditor` in a number of places as a UI element to show things like console logs.

I've had to do alot of refactoring recently, which has required a lot of cut and paste. I've had to restart Atom more frequently, leading me to ask ""why now?""

When I run a heap dump, the events object seems to just grow and grow, suggesting a leak. I haven't been able to test extensively, but a quick inspection of the events object suggests the text snippet is stored in memory, but never seems to be released. I would expect a cut operation to copy the snippet, but when I cut another snippet of text, I would expect the content of the original cut to be released from memory.

My tests have been pretty unscientific, but suggestive. I am cutting/pasting an average of 40-50 lines of code at a time. When I cut several larger snippets in reasonably quick succession, say 400 lines of code, memory consumption appears to increase more rapidly (and remain high).

I've disabled every 3rd party plugin and several core plugins. Copy/paste appears to work decently... so I've been able to work around things by copying code and deleting it, then pasting it. It's an annoying way to work though a refactor though.

I've also noticed the Atom helper typically reaching 1.9GB according to the activity monitor, but my overall RAM consumption hits 31.2 GB (of 32GB). As soon as I kill the process, it drops to 20GB total consumption.

All of this was primarily experienced on OSX (Mavericks & El Capitan) with an i5 CPU and 32GB of RAM. I've also experienced these issues on my Windows 8.1 laptop (i7 with 12GB RAM) with no change after upgrading to Win 10.

Finally, I do a fair amount of work with Electron and do not see memory issues like this in many of my apps, albeit my text editors are substantially less complex than Atom. I bring this up only because this (to me) suggests an issue with the Atom app, not the underlying Electron platform. 

I hope this helps in some way. It's reaching a point for me personally where I may have to abandon Atom due to sheer lack of productivity with it. I really hope I don't have to do that!

"793","Pass parameters to Atom commands.","I was thinking in something like

```
package:command->parameter

This way you would be able to run literally any command in Atom.
Imagine the two next examples:

**Git-Plus:**

```
Git-Plus:run-> string*
```

*where string is any git command.

**Terminal-plus**

```
Terminal-Plus:run->string*
```

*where string is any shell command.

This approach is specially powerfull if you think that you can create toolbar buttons using [tool-bar](https://github.com/suda/tool-bar). Imagine a button to compile C# like:

```
Terminal-Plus:run->mcs myproject.cs

"801","File content erased upon save when system ran out of disk space","# Description

If a disk containing a file being edited with Atom runs out of disk space, atom erases existing file content as well as edit buffer in memory upon attempt to save the file.
# Steps To Reproduce
1. Create a file with atom, add some content to it and save it to disk
2. Fill the disk with something so that you run out of disk space
3. Now in atom, modify the file you created in step 1.
4. Save the file again to store the modifications. As disk is full, atom fails to save the file but erases the existing file content upon save attempt. Atom then automatically refreshes the file content from disk, effectively erasing the file from both memory and disk upon save attempt. There is not way to recover the file content.
# Expected behavior

If there is no space on disk, the save operation should fail, the original file on disk should stay intact and most importantly the edit buffer in memory should stay intact so that the user can save the file to another disk with space

"802","Fix preview tabs","_From @benogle on October 15, 2015 22:46_

There have been a lot of issues created related to preview tabs. It seems like nearly all of these issues could be solved by a couple things:
1. Create all tabs as 'permanent' by default and only open in a preview tab in a couple cases:
   - Single clicking in the tree-view
   - Single clicking in project find results pane
   - And eventually (when open files is suuuper fast) opening preview tabs when arrowing through the fuzzy finder
2. Close the preview tab when it loses focus

The issues
- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/170
- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/206
- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/202
- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/196
- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/180
- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/173
- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/170

- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/207
- https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/163
- https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/issues/108
## The short term approach

Currently preview-tabs is implemented entirely in the tabs package. When a new pane item is opened, the tabs package closes the old pane item associated with the preview tab, and creates a new tab. So atom core (or other packages) has no idea that there are preview tabs. This is kind of crappy as
- There are hacks in the tabs package to handle things like double clicking in the tree view to make a tab permanent.
- There is no way for other packages to open preview tabs, or even know about them without accessing the tabs package
- Along the same lines, a couple folks want an API, and the only way to provide an API would be to add a service or hack to the tabs package.
  - https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/188
  - https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/185

That said, we could probably do a quick fix to change the default behavior to open a 'permanent' tab, and hack the other packages to open preview tabs in the exceptions listed above.
## The long term approach

A cleaner and more robust approach would be to bake the notion of a preview pane item into atom core. Packages could then decide to open preview items if they so choose. Then there would be no hacks: tree-view and the find results could open a preview item on single click; tabs could watch for preview items and have them all share one tab element.

@nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld not sure how much effort this longer term approach would be. Can you estimate how long it would take to add a new option to `open()` indicating the notion of a preview pane-item + related events?

There are [errors](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7854), [bugs](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6482), folks want [better feedback](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8038), and the squirrel icon + release notes are really really confusing:

- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6922
- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3757
- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8265
### What happens now
- Download an [old version](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.0.18)
- Start it
- Notice there is a blue squirrel in the status bar, and it says 'view release notes'
- Click the squirrel
- See the release notes, note that they are showing notes for an old release
- Click the restart and update button
- Atom quits, notice that there is no feedback as to what is happening.
- It's still not back. What's up?
- Atom restarts again after 5 - 15 seconds
- Notice that the release notes are up in the reloaded window. They are still out of date, and still have the 'Restart and Update' button showing and enabled
- Notice that the squirrel icon is still showing, and still blue, with the same tooltip text
- I click the squirrel because it's still there, and not going away. It focuses the release notes. Ok.
- I'm thinking: is there another update??!? What is happening?
- I check the atom menu
  - Click the 'About' item, theres no information saying it's the latest version
  - I notice there is a version number, and a 'Check for update'
  - Nothing indicates I'm at the latest version
- On reload, squirrel goes away; still nothing tells me I'm at the latest version. But no squirrel, so I guess so?
### A 70% fix

tl;dr: fix the squirrel icon, remove the release notes package, use the about package for update status (similar to chrome).
- An update becomes available
- The blue squirrel shows, its tooltip says ""Downloading update for version 1.0.20...""
- Clicking the squirrel shows the about page which shows
  - the current version
  - new version detected
  - some text indicating that the update is being downloaded
- When it's finished downloading:
  - the blue squirrel turns green, with a tooltip of ""Version 1.0.20 is available""
  - the about page now shows that an update is available, and has a button to restart the editor
  - The menu item now takes you to the about page
- Clicking the green squirrel still shows / focuses the about page
- Clicking reload reloads the editor like today
- On reload the about page is shown.
- The about page indicates that you are up to date, and has a link to the release notes
- The squirrel is _gone_ after reload as the about page has the relevant information

Additionally, take a stab at the bugs:
- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7854
- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6482

Bonus:
- In the about page, indicate which release rail you are on. beta? stable? development?
### An extra 10%

Add some kind of feedback when atom is reloading. A small window with an infinite spinner would be sufficient. The goal is to indicate that it is working.
### That last 20%
- Add progress to the download in squirrel (cc @joshaber, is this possible today?)
  - Add progress to the menu item in %
  - Add progress to the squirrel icon
    - Could add a progress bar to the tooltip
    - Could make the blue squirrel ""fill up"" with green as it progresses
- Add an option to turn off automatic downloads in the about page to fix https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1882

"813","Atom and external screens","I don't know how to describe this accurately, but I will give it a try.

**Background**
I use a laptop with a dock at work to use two extra screens. When connected to the dock I use Atom on an external screen and it works great.

**Problem**
The problem is when I close Atom and disconnect the laptop from my dock and later starts Atom again, it thinks that it's still on the external screen. Normally I just use `Windows`+`Left arrow` key to move the window to the laptop screen, but this do not work. Nothing happens.

The only think that do work is going to full screen mode. If I press `F11` then Atom shows up as expected on my laptop screen, but as soon as I exit full screen mode, Atom disappears to the (now non existent) external screen.

"814","Bad cursor positioning when mixing RTL and LTR characters","Using RTL characters only works just fine as of the latest Atom version:

![arabic](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/10359927/1b30b5a8-6d9d-11e5-8b81-7c195c18c69e.gif)

However, as soon as we add LTR characters _before_ the RTL ones, Atom won't position the cursor _inside_ the RTL text. The following does in fact work just fine:

```
اثر کارآزمودگی test test
```

Whereas the snippet below does not:

```
test test اثر کارآزمودگی 
```

With the new character measurement mechanism we now degrade gracefully, but the cursor can only be placed before and after the arabic text. This _seems_ like a limitation in the `Range` API which gets confused when mixing the two: I think this kinda makes sense 'cause I believe that, in order to provide a full RTL editing experience, we should need to go beyond character measurement.

"817","Atom serializes DisplayBuffer scroll position correctly but overwrites it when re-opening workspaces","Atom serializes the scroll position (`scrollTop` and `scrollLeft`) of each DisplayBuffer, but when you close a project / workspace and re-open it, it fails to restore the scroll position. This happens because the bounds check on `setScrollTop` doesn't have the correct data yet, and clamps every `scrollTop` value to 0:
https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/stable/src/display-buffer.coffee#L255

I'm not sure exactly what the fix should be:
- Delay applying scroll position until after the editor is attached and bounds are accurate.
- Apply the deserialized scroll position without a bounds check if the bounds are invalid.
- Do a third, better thing.

Here's why it's happening:
- `config.set ""editor.useShadowDOM"", true` is used in the [spec-helper](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/37503b4d03f3f0162738332ff9693641b9ffdd40/spec/spec-helper.coffee#L138)
- true is the default value for this setting, so [`value = undefined if _.isEqual(defaultValue, value)`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/37503b4d03f3f0162738332ff9693641b9ffdd40/src/config.coffee#L835) in config.coffee:setRawValue() is run
- At this point `atom.config.settings.editor.useShadowDOM` is actually set to undefined.
- When the package is loaded, it resets the config schema, and pushes `atom.config.settings` back through the schema validators. **But** `atom.config.settings.editor.useShadowDOM` is `undefined`, which is not a valid value! So warning

Not sure what to do here. I assume the undefined value is supposed to remove the key from the settings, but I dont know the current state of things. @maxbrunsfeld @nathansobo any insight?

If you have the cursor before a soft-tab and hit space, the cursor won't move but the content following all spaces will.  Until you hit space again then it jumps:

``` js
// Tab-width = 2

"826","Consider an `onDidStopChangingActivePaneItem`","Similar to the motivation behind [`TextEditor::onDidStopChanging`](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.1.0-beta.0/TextEditor#instance-onDidStopChanging),  clients of `onDidChangeActivePaneItem` should nearly always wait for a small time period before acting on the new pane item. If the user is quickly switching through tabs or closing several tabs in quick succession, work done on [`Workspace::onDidChangeActivePaneItem`](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.1.0-beta.0/Workspace#instance-onDidChangeActivePaneItem) is likely wasted and can become a bottleneck for giving feedback to the user if they are switching/closing tabs quickly.

There's at least one candidate in core that could defer its actions until the active item has stopped changing: [`FileInfoView`](https://github.com/atom/status-bar/blob/master/lib/file-info-view.coffee#L71) in the status bar.

Nuclide wrapped `onDidChangeActivePaneItem` to get this effect: https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/atom-helpers/lib/atom-event-debounce.js#L29

I think a `DidStopChangingActivePaneItem` should be recommended similar to the one in `TextEditor` if it's created.

It's much easier to see if you open the GIF in a new tab.

Basically what's happening is whenever I select enough text to scoll the editor (ie the scrollbars are moving), the text becomes blurry and stays that way until I scroll a bit out of its range and then back (guessing this has something to do with tiles).  Both horizontal and vertical scrolling are affected.

Also tested in safe mode.  Windows 10 x64, Atom 1.0.19, though this has been happening for a _long_ time.

"830","ALT+F opens File menu item, but only if no file is open","On main menu, the File item is underlined on the F letter. ALT+F opens it, but only if no file is open. If a file is open, Atom instead advances to the next word, like CTRL+Right.

I understand this may be a terminal/vim-like behavior. However, a shortcut's behavior should be consistent. Either it opens the File menu item, or it doesn't.

ALT+H (for the Help menu item) has this problem, too.

I don't know why they are different .I think there may be some network problems .

But I cann't verify which package is the right package, I think there should be a hash value list of release packages .Just like centos.org  ,they provide a md5sum.txt to tell the md5 of the iso files.

There is already a RELEASES ,but it only about the nupkg files, and is that SHA1 or what ?

Some days ago a malware called 'xcodeghost' cames out .XcodeGhost is a compiler malware in OS X. Its malicious code is located in a Mach-O object file that was repackaged into some versions of Xcode installers. I'm afraid there may be someone do the same to Atom in the future .

So I think there should be a md5sum.txt or something like that in the page of releases page for users to verify the setup_files.

"835","Make it easier to add top/bottom bars","From this discussion: https://discuss.atom.io/t/placing-element-at-top-of-atom-for-package/21118
#### Problem:

Currently you can't easily add a bar to the top or bottom that spans across the whole width. If you try, it pushes down the status bar. I guess because `atom-workspace-axis` has `height: 100%`.

![screen shot 2015-09-25 at 3 22 20 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/10094309/40c5935a-6399-11e5-92df-bc56f4986499.png)

An option is to add it above/below the editor, like `tool-bar` currently does, but that might not be desired for all packages.
#### Possible solution:

Add two empty `<atom-panel-container>` as children of `<atom-workspace>`. They're just placeholders and won't take up space if they are empty, but it would allow other packages to fill them.

I've poked around at the new events from the vim-mode point of view, and without the `originalEvent`, there's no way to fix it other than to create tons of unique events, like in [this commit](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/commit/d73e0916c51374c22c36fb4fd9931e7ded0b4c17), which is so bad I can't bring myself to make a PR out of it.

It seems like the breaking commit is attempting to keep the API the same, but the original event keys are part of the event prototype, not the event, so they're not copied. It looks like there's been [some work on that file](https://github.com/atom/atom/commits/master/src/command-registry.coffee) since the breaking commit, but nothing in the last day or two, so I'm hoping this isn't a duplicate.

For reference, the vim-mode code that's referencing the missing `originalEvent` is [here](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/blob/master/lib/vim-state.coffee#L587-L588) and [here](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/blob/master/lib/vim-state.coffee#L575-L576). And the break is pretty dramatic, making vim-mode more or less unusable.

"862","No way to go from a TextEditor to a File","A `TextEditor` has a `TextBuffer` which likely (but is not guaranteed to) have a `File`. `TextEditor` has a public `getBuffer()` method, but there is no public API on `TextBuffer` to get to the corresponding `File`.

As a result, instead of passing around a `File`, most packages pass around a string `path`, which is assumed to be a local file path. This can lead to bugs like:

https://github.com/gandm/language-babel/issues/66

because it's not safe to assume you can call things like `require('path').dirname()` on the path from the `TextEditor` because it might be a URI rather than a local file path:

https://github.com/bolinfest/language-babel/blob/b3fe5a544b2c707f5094a327788b0eb438cf0f25/lib/transpiler.coffee#L174

"881","Atom does not use the system font on Linux (and Mac and Windows)","Atom does not actually use the system font for its UI. [The ""font stack"" solution currently implemented](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8612) hardcodes a bunch of fonts in the hope that the default font for every possible installation is included. This is not a big issue on Mac and Windows where it is ~~impossible~~ almost impossible – and very unusual – to change the system font.

Not so on Linux. As an example, I use Fedora which comes with Cantarell by default. I don't like Cantarell and have changed my system font to Source Sans Pro instead (easily done in GNOME). All of my desktop applications respect the change, except Atom because it has Cantarell hardcoded in its font stack and since Cantarell is still present on my system it is used instead.

The solution is to make Atom use the system fonts like other desktop applications. Instead of guessing which font the user wants, it should query the system for the default font to use. IMO this should also extend to the fixed-width font and themes explicitly setting the font family should be the exception rather than the rule. No matter which theme I choose, there is almost never a good reason for one application to use a different font than the others.

1. Create a new Markdown document with the content below
2. Use mentioned syntax theme and typeface
3. Notice the color difference between quote 10 and 11
### Cause

Normally, with my settings, all lines are 21px high, and normal text is rendered with a height of 16px. In the example however, the #-sign, scoped as `markup heading marker gfm`, whose `font-weight: bold` inherited from being a heading, is reset to `font-weight: normal`. This causes the #-sign to be rendered as **17px** high, making the line itself **22px** instead of 21px, and pushing a single pixel outside the tile, causing the entire tile to lose subpixel anti-aliasing. Furthermore, as far as I have been able to deduce, this only happens when the `font-weight` is reset from `bold` to `normal`, although this could be a coincidence of course.

Heads up to @as-cii who I've already discussed this with on Slack. And can someone give me a detective's badge, cause I certainly feel like one! : )

"886","Clicking (not dragging) starts highlighting text","On Ubuntu 15.04 (which is not on VM), clicking on Atom starts highlighting text.  This problem occurs on Atom 1.0.8 and 1.0.9 but doesn't occur on Atom 1.0.7.  No error messages are shown in DevTools' Console.

Adding `--safe` option and resetting Config, Init Script, Keymap, Snippets, and Stylesheet don't change anything.  The problem still occurs.

This is the screen capture.  I am not dragging.  I just click several times while moving the cursor on the editor.  Though there's no cursor in the movie, it is capture app's issue.

Would it make more sense to have an `emacs-mode` package for people who wants this? This would be akin to the `vim-mode` package which adds `vim` functionalitites to `Atom`.

Atom has the ability to create and set content for lines that don't exist in the buffer. This is used for soft-wrapping text. Package creators would benefit from an api to do this manually, for example ""to add some virtual lines for references"" (Ominisharp-atom) or to make space for custom/temporary UI elements (preview-inline).

4. As soon as two lines are selected the text editor begins to scroll rapidly in a state that is only possible to exit by stop selection.

The practical use case for me is when you split the editor vertically it's nothing strange to have just 5 lines in one of the panes.

Suggested solution is to use a relative auto vscroll select area instead of an absolute.

Apologies for the long title.

Instead, the cursor is placed _after_ the comment, which I find rather unintuitive.

## Background:

We use [Palo Alto Security Appliances](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/firewalls/pa-5000/overview.html) to protect our ingress and egress network traffic from malware and other threats to our network and data. Palo Alto does this by using a wildcard certificate that has been generated from our Enterprise PKI and which is trusted on all Company-owned workstations and servers.

> Not looking to get into a debate about SSL decryption or man-in-the-middle attacks for SSL. This is at my work, and we have legal and regulatory requirements to break SSL, inspect the traffic, and then re-encrypt it before it leaves our network.

I know _why_ Atom is failing here. It's seeing what it thinks is a bad certificate in the mix, and that the traffic is being attacked (MiTM). I understand _why_ Atom is failing here. But in this case, the traffic is _legitimately_ being broken, for _legitimate_ reasons.
## Feature Request:

I would like to request the addition of a hidden configuration option that, when enabled, would cause Atom to **ignore SSL certificate errors**.

> Yes I know this is risky for end-users. Yes, I know this reduces the overall security, which is why I don't think the configuration setting should be easily ""discoverable"" or that there shouldn't be a UI element for it. Hopefully that wouldn't allow a non-technical user to accidentally enable it and potentially reduce their security.
### Alternately:

If Atom would show the actual URL that's being blocked, or that raised the error, we could then add the URL to a white-list to bypass SSL decryption on our side, allowing packages and themes  to be installed.

Of course, it would be helpful if packages and themes were distributed from a central repository with a common organizational structure and naming convention. :smile:

Syntax theme looks awful for these languages. Syntax-theme developers must create a syntax rule for each language. It's a real headache.
##### I suggest:
- Add docs for grammar naming conventions
- Mention about naming conventions
  - ... in generated `syntax.less`
  - ... in grammar files
- Make sure general languages follow naming conventions:
  - [Javascript](https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/issues/201) atom/language-javascript#206
  - [C#](https://github.com/atom/language-csharp/issues/33) atom/language-csharp#34
  - [Go](https://github.com/atom/language-go/issues/62)

Mention in files might be something like this:

- [x] Make the Gruntfile compile babel files

When the `editor.tabType` option is set to `auto` it uses the `editor.softTabs` setting to determine tab type in new, empty files. IMO, this setting should stick around but have its name updated to be more consistent with `editor.tabType`.

When you've deleted lines, it should have a `.removed` class on the line prior to the lines removed.
When you've edited a line, it should have a `.modified` class on it
And finally, when you've added a new line, it should have a `.new` class on it

"918","Gutter line-number width minimum two characters","This is a suggestion: the space for line numbers in the gutter should be at least two characters wide, so that the transition from 9 lines to 10 doesn't change the gutter width. 

The reasoning goes like this: this transition happens when we've just started writing a new file, it is quite likely (few files are below 9 lines), and can be a distracting unexpected movement in peripheral vision. 

I was torn out of concentration by this sudden movement once too many times, so now I have this in my `styles.less`:

``` less
atom-text-editor {
  &,
  &::shadow {
    .gutter .line-number {
      min-width: 4.5ch; // 4.5 and not 2 because there's something else there, too
    }
  }
}
```

But that feels sub-optimal.

Even better (but much harder to implement) would be a width that smoothly increases (it could be set to _log10(lines)+1_ ch, again minimum 2ch) so that gutter width never jumps during normal editing.

"920","Copy-paste doesn't work properly with Unix-style line endings under Windows","Copying (Ctrl+C-Ctrl+V) from a file with Unix-style line ending (LF) doesn't work as expected, since line endings are _preserved_ on the clipboard.

This causes a wide range of issues:
- you can't paste text in an application that doesn't handle LF (notepad for example, but if you're using vim over PuTTY that also doesn't work)
- even if the other app handles LF, you have to be consistent, so you can't paste text from an CRLF file into a LF one or vice versa

This issue is briefly discussed in #2822, and it is the reason of #5808.

**All other editors convert line endings in text placed on the clipboard** (Sublime Text, jEdit, etc.), so in this regard Atom behaves rather strangely compared to other editors.

The proposed solution in #2822 (configurable line endings) is insufficient since it's based on the assumption that _all_ files edited by the user are using the same line ending.
For example, if I've got a file with LF line endings and I'd like to use copy-paste, then I **have to convert it to CRLF** and then **copy the text** I want, and **then convert it back to LF** to preserve the original format. I wouldn't call editing LF files on Windows a rare use case, especially among Atom's users.

Atom should convert any text's line ending to the platform's native line ending _before_ it is placed on the clipboard. This conversion should only be done on the content that is placed on the clipboard—the text in the buffer should not be changed.

"921","Windows 10 - Crashes","## Apologies in advance

I apologize if this has already been reported, but I couldn't find it anywhere.  Please close this issue if that's the case.  It's an oddball case.
## Platform and Version

**Platform** Windows 10
**Version** Atom 1.0.7
**Safe Mode?** Yep, that crashes too.
**Remote FileSystem** SMB Share from Mac machine (Yosemite) (as a mapped drive or as just the share itself).
## Steps to Reproduce
- Create a samba (SMB) share on a Mac machine.
- Navigate to that share on your Windows machine and authenticate.
- Tell Atom.io to open a directory within that share.
- With Windows Explorer, change a file name within the share, or simply re-navigate to the share by going to a directory above the one you opened with Atom.io and then back into the opened directory.  There are many, many things you can do at this point.
- Atom.io crashes.
## Other Tests

My situation might be a bit _unique_ so again I will apologize if it makes it hard to debug. I have tested this same setup using a linux samba share as well as a Windows file share and Atom.io behaves very well and **_never crashes**_ in those setups.  It might be something to do with how the Mac (Yosemite) samba shares are created.

All shares I used required authentication different from that of my Windows workstation.  All shares were on an AD domain using domain credentials.

So it happens that atom updated to version 1.0.6, but when I look at the files in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\atom\bin` I can see that these ~~binary~~ executable files all refer to `app-1.0.4`. By having this issue multiple times, I know I can fix this by rewriting this to `app-1.0.6`, but it would be very convenient if the updater all does this on instead of wasting time on figuring out why its not working.

"923","Cannot scroll/move cursor to the end of the line when using the ""Base16 Tomorrow Dark"" syntax theme.","### Description:

With soft-wrap disabled and a long line of text that exceeds the available viewport width of the editor pane, erroneous behaviour is observed when attempting to go to the end of the line either via the (bottom) scroll bar or through the doesn't work properly and requires a repeat invocation to work as expected.
### Steps to reproduce:

You can reproduce this either using the scroll bar or using a keyboard command (e.g. `editor:move-to-end-of-screen-line` with whatever key shortcut applies on your platform/configuration).
1. Open Atom with an empty file. Make sure soft wrap is disabled.
2. type a long string on a single line --- your string should exceed the width of the editor viewport.
3. Press <kbd>End</kbd> or try to scroll (using the scrollbar at the bottom of the editor pane) as far right as you can.
### Actual results:

In the case of the end-of-line keyboard shortcut, the cursor does move to the end of the line, but both cursor and end of line content is not visible.

In the case of the scrollbar, you cannot go past a point which is just before the end of the line. The cursor remains hidden, as does the end of the line.
### Expected results:

In the case of the scrollbar event, you should be able to actually read the content at the end of the line, with some appropriate padding.

In the case of the keyboard commands, you should see both end of line content and the cursor blinking there.
### Notes:
- Repeating the `editor:move-to-end-of-screen-line` command one more time does move to the end of the line. I couldn't find a way to achieve this using the scroll bar.
- This issue was consistently reproducible on OS X.

The _Exclude VCS Ignored Paths_ setting under Core Settings commonly gets confused with the similar setting under the Tree View package, _Hide VCS Ignored Paths_. I believe the first is for excluding files from search and the latter is for the tree view itself. 

For an idealized UI I'd vote for removing both settings and adding a new one that is a Select box where we can select to _exclude_ (from search and tree view), _exclude from search only_, and _show_. It doesn't make sense (to me) to allow not showing in the tree view but showing up in search.

"943","Improving Atom's release notes / changelogs","## Challenge

Being a very modular project, Atom has a lot of changes happening across a lot of repos. This can make it quite a challenge to keep track of all the changes being made in Atom from version to version. Unfortunately, that has sort of meant that our release notes end up being rather bare-bones summaries of what's changed in any particular version, rather than complete, well, changelogs. In addition, none of our bundled packages or libraries have any release notes at all right now - it's only Atom core. 

I think it's important to publicly document every significant change we make to Atom across all of our repos, which should make it a lot easier for users to know what to expect from each release, and hopefully help prevent surprises like https://github.com/atom/toggle-quotes/commit/8899f00c846d9e1525985f551f79cfb134f1bf5b#commitcomment-12552713 or https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8226.
## Proposal
1. Add `CHANGELOG.md` files to each package and library repo (or leverage GitHub Releases)
   - I'm personally :+1: for `CHANGELOG.md` files - they're version-controlled, simple to update, easy to discover, and will be displayed properly in settings-view.
2. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` to atom/atom to be used exclusively for core changes
3. Update them individually with each significant changes as they are made
4. Concatenate and organize all changelogs for atom.io/releases
   - For UI here it might be nice to take some inspiration from [Firefox release notes](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/39.0/releasenotes/) - default to the short summary display, and offer a ""view full list of changes"" option for those who really want to dig deeper.
   - Maybe even add the ability to filter by package / library?
5. atom/atom release notes (ie. the notes used in GitHub Releases, rather than the `CHANGELOG.md`) can continue to work as the short summary of what changed.

"947","Introduce scheme to `npm dedupe` npm dependencies of Atom packages","Currently, the organization of the `~/.atom/packages` directory makes it impossible to dedupe dependencies, potentially causing a lot of bloat.

Specifically, in the case of Nuclide, we have our [`nuclide-installer`](https://atom.io/packages/nuclide-installer) package that is used to install our collection of Nuclide packages. In the most recent release of Nuclide (v0.0.26), there are 17 such packages to install: https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-installer/blob/v0.0.26/lib/config.json.

The way `nuclide-installer` works is that it starts up and then runs `apm install` for each package in that `config.json` file. On my machine (where `~/.npm` was already populated with all of the dependencies used by these packages), it took `nuclide-installer` 6 minutes to install all 17 Atom packages and the resulting `~/.atom/packages` directory was 903M! That's enormous! This is bad for several reasons:
- 903M is an order of magnitude more disk space than is necessary if dependencies could be de-duped.
- The installation process is much slower than it has to be.
- Much more JavaScript code has to be loaded at runtime.
- I suspect that the JavaScript in `~/.atom/packages` is not loaded as efficiently as the JavaScript in `/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar`, putting third-party code at even more of a disadvantage.

I suspect that the only thing I can do right now without any changes to Atom is have `~/.atom/nuclide-installer` create a special directory structure under itself. Maybe something like:

```
~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/
~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/atom_packages/
```

where npm packages common to multiple Nuclide Atom packages would be written to `~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/` (obviously there could only be one version per common dependency) and then each Atom package would be in its own directory under `~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/atom_packages/`. Under that scheme, only an npm dependency that already had an entry under `~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/` would also have to exist under `~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/atom_packages/<ATOM PACKAGE>/node_modules` if a different version were required.

Once everything was in place, `nuclide-installer` would run `apm link` for each entry in `~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/atom_packages`.

While I'm [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), I would probably add another directory of indirection so that the directory structure would be parameterized by version number:

```
~/.atom/nuclide-installer/v0.0.26/node_modules/
~/.atom/nuclide-installer/v0.0.26/node_modules/atom_packages/
```

This way, `nuclide-installer` could be writing out v0.0.27 and would not switch over until all of the files were in place.

This is really important for Nuclide, so I'm willing to hack this into `nuclide-installer`, but it would be nice if there were a way for Atom to support this natively so that others could also provide package bundles efficiently for Atom.

```

```

There are also some Atom-specific calls to `atom.config.get` and `atom.confirm`.

"952","Option for zero-indexed line numbers","I've always wanted zero-indexed line numbers. That's what I'm used to: other than nutty environments like Excel/AppleScript/Matlab/etc, arrays are always zero-indexed. But perplexingly no programmer's editor supports them. Zero-indexed line numbers make counting lines, sets of lines, and newline characters easier, since the line number is literally the index of the line. The correspondence is so well suited that pointer/index arithmetic carries over seamlessly. And this would be exceptionally easy to implement in the core.

"954","Atom does not recognize git worktree repositories","When `git-repository-provider.coffee` searches for the git repository it looks for the `.git` directory, however `git worktree` creates repositories that have `.git` file that has `gitdir: path/to/gitdir` as contents. As a result atom cannot currently work with repositories created with `git worktree`. Unfortunately even making `.git` a symlink doesn't work, since worktree gitdir doesn't have `objects` or `refs` subdirectories.

Atom should recognize `.git` files that start with `gitdir:` as valid git repositories.

I understand I can potentially get at the error messages by using the internal debugging tools, but that seems a bit obfuscated. Can't it show more information about crashes when they occur? I realise that this is a more of a hacker-oriented tool, but you're reaching wider audiences with the adverts, etc, I personally don't want to run it in dev mode 24/7 just to get info on the crashes :)

"962","Shrink or scroll editor when panels at bottom open up","If this has been raised before or if this is the wrong repo, please correct me. I couldn't find a previous issue for it. I've raised this issue at the atom linter repository originally, see https://github.com/atom-community/linter/issues/758, but we felt this was a more widespread issue and not the responsibility of the linter package.

Considering that [linter might get integrated into the atom core](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7353), it's probably a good idea to handle this issue in atom core anyway.

The problem is with panels that open up at the bottom of the Atom window (e.g. find & replace, linter) while you are working on code which is at the bottom of a file. These panels overlap your code when they open, hiding the code from view and forcing you to scroll up.

Type something erroneous at the bottom:
![ss](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aplhj66dn0mohfv/Screenshot%202015-07-21%2011.57.04.png?dl=1)

Panel shows up and overlaps your code:
![ss](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqren1bvolmc2l9/Screenshot%202015-07-21%2011.57.35.png?dl=1)

The problem is particularly troublesome with automatically opened windows, like linter. The find & replace panel never bothered me like that, because it's triggered manually with a keyboard command, so you're not focussed on typing code anyway. But with the linter panel, you are, and it's very disturbing to have the panel suddenly show up and block your view of your code.

A proposed work around has been to enable the setting ""Scroll Past End"", but while this alleviates the issue a little bit, it doesn't solve it and it can still happen when you forgot to scroll further up.

A better solution would probably be for the panels to not overlap the editor window, but rather push it up causing it to shrink. I realize this might cause the opposite problem though, e.g. if you're typing at the top of the file, then that code would be pushed out of view.

Any idea's?

At the building stage (script/build), the script ends at the following task without dumping any errors:

`Running ""download-atom-shell"" task`

If you are facing on the same issue, it is probably due to a bug with the request module failing with users behind proxy (https://github.com/atom/node-github-releases/issues/2).

You can add the `--stack` option to the file `script/utils/run-grunt.js` to dump the hidden error to your console (@ the line 14):

`var args = ['--gruntfile', path.resolve('build', 'Gruntfile.coffee'), '--stack'];`

Then rebuild Atom thanks to the same command line `./script/build` will probably dump a similar error:

```
TypeError: Request path contains unescaped characters.
…
```

I temporary fixed the issue by removing my *_proxy env variables (bash):

`unset http_proxy https_proxy ftp_proxy HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY FTP_PROXY no_proxy NO_PROXY`

and then everything goes well:

```
Running ""download-atom-shell"" task
Running ""download-atom-shell-chromedriver"" task

"980","[Feature request] Dialog with unsaved changes should accept ""Don't save all""","Hey, when working on a large project I often find myself opening lots of files that I often forgot to close (and sometimes they are deleted from the filesystem while still being opened). When I am about to close the project, I need to click ""Don't save"" more than 30 times to close it. It would be really nice to have ""No to all"" option that I can just click (in my case, I am using source control so I am pretty sure all changes I wanted to save were already committed).

That's the dialog I am talking about:

"981","Showing line numbers disables sub-pixel AA on tabs, status-bar etc.","In https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui/issues/82, @wiox noticed that sub-pixel anti aliasing is not only disabled for the tabs, but also on the fuzzy finder and the status bar.

![sub-pixel](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/8694250/9299865a-2b18-11e5-8f8d-936466ccedf6.png)

It seems it's caused by the line number tiles getting promoted to a GPU layer and probably related to #7101. Kinda strange that it affects different areas.

Something that might be worth looking into is using `will-change`. It also adds a GPU layer for the line numbers, but doesn't affect the rest. Notice the orange ""composited layer borders"" only appear in the status bar with `-webkit-transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px);` but not with `will-change: transform;`.

Now, I _heard_ that `will-change` should only be used when interacting, like on hover or so.. and not kept permanently enabled. So not sure if that would help. /cc @as-cii @nathansobo 

**Edit:** Sorry, I just realized that the `transform` is needed to actually move line numbers. So can't be replaced. :grin:

"983","Vertical resize only/resize to fit content","Feature suggestion: on OS X general window resizing behaviour is to resize the window to fit the content inside (reduce scrollbars) instead of filling the entire screen (for example Finder, Chrome). The advantage is that the maximum amount of needed space for the text window is used (leaving little empty background) while leaving screen real estate for other apps/windows.

This would be a use preference. 
Scaling options would be to scale to fit content (longest line) or to fit word wrap boundary (wrapping long lines in the process). 
The resize process would scale to fit horizontally and scale to fit the screen height vertically.

"984","zoomFontWhenCtrlScrolling causes surprising behavior when pressing Ctrl with inertial scrolling","Due to inertial scrolling, `mousewheel` events may continue to be fired even after the user has stopped ""actively"" scrolling. This is expected. What may be surprising is that while this inertial scrolling is happening, pressing/holding Ctrl will behave the same as if the user is ""actively"" scrolling.

Try this on a Mac to see how surprising it feels: enable zoomFontWhenCtrlScrolling, then quickly swipe up/down on your trackpad in a file. Shortly after, hold Ctrl. Due to the file still being scrolled, the font size starts changing.

It seems like zoomFontWhenCtrlScrolling handling could be ""smarter"" about detecting whether the user intended this by detecting whether Ctrl was pressed first or if scrolling was already happening before Ctrl was pressed.

I had the vim-mode package installed but disabled. I manually clicked the ""update package"" button (not the ""update all"" button). After the package had been updated, it seemed that it re-enabled itself. I would have expected it to remain disabled.

"996","Atom on ARM Information","_Hi :wave: This issue is an informational issue about the state of running Atom on computers with ARM processors (like those in Raspberry Pis and some Chromebooks)._

---

**Atom does not _effectively_ work on ARM** (July 9th, 2015)

![atom-10-launch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1305617/8609239/94cbf112-2657-11e5-8381-d6b5c74e6bd7.png)

It does, however, now _build_ and _launch_ on ARM (see image above from ARM Chromebook). This is due to the fact that [Electron](http://github.com/atom/electron), as of `v0.29.0` now builds an [ARM compatible distribution](https://github.com/atom/electron/releases/tag/v0.29.0) :sparkles: (as an aside, this is really, really great news for future applications and tinkerers). But the latest versions of Electron use a newer version of Chrome and have not been tested against Atom which [currently uses](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/package.json#L15) `v.22.3` of Electron (at this time Electron was still named Atom-Shell). Typing and clicking don't work at all and/or trigger lots of exception notifications and render the application pretty useless. This could be because of the new Electron compatibility issues, but we can't be quite sure as we don't really know yet what those issues are. 

**What will it take to get there?**

These errors will have to be sorted out and fixed. This is not on any roadmap right now and could be a lot of work (patches welcome! :raised_hands:). Getting Atom upgraded to the latest Electron will help answer this question but it's not there just yet (https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6877). 

It's worth noting that  even if Atom were on the latest Electron, you will still need to build it yourself because it requires some other adjustments (see below). 

**Want to try it out?**

Maybe it will _just work_ on your machine! I have a [gist with the steps](https://gist.github.com/jlord/7ffaf94d041982346934) to build. It involves using forks of both apm (Atom's package manager) and Atom so that you can build apm with [io.js](https://iojs.org) instead of Node.js since the later does not support ARM.

However, this is not the case on my Windows box.

Since the command is spawned in a sub-shell `cmd.exe` (which is an aweful default setup, this should be optional), the handler is never called but the default error message of `cmd.exe` is logged on `stderr` and the process (in this case `cmd.exe`) exits with status code `1`. This means the above mentioned spec should fail running on Windows, which seems to me like a bug in `BufferedProcess`.

Simply adding `atom = global.atom || global.atomApplication` at the beginning of isBundledPackagePath() fixes this, but there may be an underlying issue that needs to be addressed here.

"1004","Preserve CSON formatting","This one may be a long shot, but I'd still like to mention it.  Is there any way to preserve the formatting of a CSON configuration file whenever Atom needs to write and save to it?

The reason I mention it, is because I'm a big fan of having comments in config files so I know what each config does, and it also helps with organization and readability.

Say this is my `config.cson`

``` cson
#
# Config
#

            'wrap-guide'
        ]
        themes: [
            'one-dark-ui'
            'solarized-dark-syntax'
        ]

    # EDITOR
    editor:
        invisibles: {}

        autocompleteBrackets: false
        autocompleteSmartQuotes: false

    # WHITESPACE
    whitespace:
        ensureSingleTrailingNewline: false
```

Once Atom saves it, it's changed to this:

``` cson
""*"":
  welcome:
    showOnStartup: false
  core:
    disabledPackages: [
      ""autocomplete-plus""
      ""wrap-guide""

  ""bracket-matcher"":
    autocompleteBrackets: false
    autocompleteSmartQuotes: false
  whitespace:
    ensureSingleTrailingNewline: false
```

I completely understand the reason for why it happens, which is why I said it's a long shot.  But I think one of the nice things about having our own custom configs is being able to organize it the way we want, so if there could be any way to preserve it that would be great.

I got used to Sublime positioning the single cursor at the original cursor location.  At first, I thought it was an arbitrary decision and that I would adjust to atom's way of doing it.  Now I've decided that it's not entirely subjective.  In many cases, my original cursor was intentionally placed at the original position, and that's where I would like it to return to.  For example, maybe I was editing something in-line and thought that this particular word (variable name) I was editing should be edited in a few places at the same time.  After doing this, I would like to return to my original train of thought - editing that line that I was on before creating multiple selections.  I would also think that in any cases where I didn't intentionally place my cursor on a particular instance, the decision is arbitrary whether it takes me to the original or final cursor upon pressing `esc`, so this might be a safe change to make for all use cases.  At least an option for altering this behavior would be much-appreciated.

When more than one projects are opened on the editor, if we edit a file on the project added after the first one, the path shown just after the name of the opened file in the windows title bar is always the path of the first opened project.

- Add projectA, and projectB.
- Open a file on projectB.

This seems reasonable (although I wish it would ask me for my sudo password instead).
However, if I modify it and then close it, Atom will ask me if I want to save it, and when I click ""yes"", it closes the file and gives me that same popup that it failed to save. This means my work is lost. I don't think I have used an editor before that doesn't keep the file open if it fails to save and I believe this should be considered a bug, right?

Currently that's not possible, because dev mode windows necessarily share the same config with regular Atom windows, so changing the theme in one window will always change the theme in all windows.

It would be awesome if you could scope config to dev mode, so you can tailor Atom as needed for your development windows.

- add two new commands ""Enable soft tabs"" and ""Disable soft tabs"" to avoid this issue altogether
- an icon in the status bar showing softness of tabs?

"1027","Possible to accept commands/key bindings without Atom window?","For example when using the [Atom project manager](https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager), it's very inconvenient that when you've closed all your windows and want to open a new project, you have to open a new Atom window first before the command to open a new project can be used.

Seeing how this command is more of a ""global"" command, and shouldn't really need a window, is it possible for Atom to somehow accept such commands without window (but with the app itself having focus) and just open a new window as needed?

The work around now is to either remember not to close your last project window, open a new project, and then switch back to close the last one, or close all of them, open a new window, and then open a new project. Since opening a new window takes quite a bit of time to load, it's a bit of a hassle whichever way you do it, and it would be much more optimal if you could just open an existing project, and for that command to open the new window for you.

```

Note that the user has just used <kbd>Ctrl-T</kbd>, no other key was pressed.  In Atom, I have to <kbd>Ctrl-T</kbd>, <kbd>right</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl-T</kbd>, <kbd>right</kbd>, ... to achieve the same effect.

Furthermore it accepts anonymous objects as messages allowing the providers to write unit-tests.

It also has a UI to show errors from the current file or project. Which is very important for the Nuclide IDE and project-based languages like FlowJS, HackLang and others. and the Error Objects can contain traces that expand over the lines. It is also extremely easy to style. and It doesn't have to save a temp file to disk to lint files. It also supports `lintOnFly` and `onSave` linters.

It even exports it's self service to packages who have daemons in separate processes and want to trigger lint without waiting for a save or change in the buffer. Also in the tooltip and bottom panel are positions that user can click on and be directed to the file:line:col instead of just jumping to the next error.

All these features remove all of the known limitations of old `linter` package.
**Note:** It's also backward compatible, so all the linters using the old API will still work.

Here is how it looks like at the moment
![screenshot from 2015-06-20 19 09 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4278113/8269940/e232c69c-177f-11e5-8710-8b2acf1380fb.png)

There are a lot of packages that have re-invented the wheel and written their own error UIs. If we merge `linter` in the core, all those packages can consume a similar API and eventually reduce their code complexity.

Things to be done
- [ ] Make the code shine bright (We have been working [hard](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-plus/graphs) on this one)
- [ ] Move it to the `atom` org.

Let us know what you guys think.

"1042","Proposal: Improve tab titles when opening files with the same name","When opening multiple files with the same base name (but in different directories) it is hard to distinguish which tab is associated with which file. Currently, when Atom detects that multiple files with the same name are opened it appends the complete project path after the filename, but it is cut off (making it not very helpful). The user must use their mouse to hover over the tab to know the full path. I think the logic can be improved by including the parent directory name to the left of the file name as shown below:
# One tab

This diabolical character triggers a Gremlin mode in Atom!

If I remove the character  `i´` in Sublime and then paste in Atom, everything goes back to normal.

I am able to reproduce this similarly to the bug we had in #7306:
- Write a few paragraphs of text (ensure it enables vertical scrolling).
- Scroll to the very bottom.
- Split the pane (I split it right, but I think left or anything else will do).
- Ensure that splitting the pane has caused the editor on the left to scroll up.
- Scroll the left panel again to the very bottom.
- Close the right panel.
- Fold any line.
- The wrong line was folded. :boom:

If I have this file opened already then it just goes to the line 42. But not always.
It works like this only if this file is located in the active(last used) pane in atom. But if I'll activate (just click inside) another pane and then click on the path in console output then atom will open the file in a new tab in that pane.

I think it would be much more convenient if it will search for the file among all panes before opening the file in a new tab.

"1064","Atom doesn't respect saved session if opened with file arguments","If Atom opens without arguments, it restores session with all tabs and project folders. If launch Atom with file arguments (via terminal or shorctut association) and it's already opened, it only opens a new tab for file and keeps current project folders and other tabs.
But if launch Atom with file arguments and no other instance is opened, all saved session becomes lost, it changes project folder to file's root and opens only one tab for executed file.
For example, Sublime respects saved session in that case too.

"1065","ctrl-0 conflicts on Windows and cannot reset font size","When I hit `ctrl-0` in an editor pane, I expect the font-size to reset. Instead, the tree view focus is toggled. The `ctrl-=` and `ctrl--` keystrokes both work to increase and decrease the font size, and `ctrl-0` is listed under the ""View"" toolbar menu as being the appropriate keyboard shortcut for resetting font size.

There are no errors in the Developer Tools. The issue appears simply to be a keystroke conflict. For `.platform-win32, .platform-linux`, `ctrl-0` toggles tree view as well as resets font size, and tree view toggle apparently wins.

Let's say I have this long line:

Now let's say I resize Atom's window so the line can't fit in a single row, specifically, the text `port in Atom.` is forced on a new row.

Now,  I'd expect that if I place the cursor at the beginning of the line and hit `Shift + End`, the entire text is selected. I'd even accept as a reasonable behavior if Atom selects everything up to the `test a bug re` part, but that is not the case. Atom is actually selecting everything on the first row of the line, except the last character. That is, in my example, after placing the cursor at the beginning of the line and hitting `Shift + End`, Atom is selecting this:

"1078","Running Atom from shell fails on Windows","**Version:** Atom v0.207
**OS:** Windows 8.1

Hello. Recently, when I tried to run `atom somefile.txt` from [Git for Windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases), I got an error in the `atom` script that said `No such file or directory`. When I opened the `atom` script file, I saw this:

```
""$0/../../app-0.204.0/resources/cli/atom.sh"" ""$@""
```

Realizing that `$0` should instead have been `$(dirname $0)` instead, I replaced it and tried again. I also found this problem in the script it pointed to (atom.sh).

The problem is that **when Atom updates it erases the fix**, which is why I filed this bug report.

As someone [in the forums](https://discuss.atom.io/t/running-atom-from-shell-doesnt-work-on-windows/17496) noted, `atom.cmd` works fine.

"1080","application:open-file should default to the directory where the currently viewed file resides","The title says everything. If you have several files open, and press CTRL-O, at the moment the open dialog will default to ""Recently Used"". However, it makes a _lot_ of sense to default, as a starting point, to the directory where the file currently viewed is.

For example if you are working on the file `youtRepo/auth/button/facebook.js`, and you want to open `youtRepo/auth/button/local.js`, you should be able to press CTRL-O and find yourself in `youtRepo/auth/button/`. Again, this is what happens in Sublime and I find it immensely helpful.

I tried to do it myself, but I am not familiar with Atom's code. However, the relevant lines seem to be https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/browser/atom-application.coffee#L225-L227 and https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/browser/atom-application.coffee#L171.

- https://github.com/jokeyrhyme/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/update.sh

One of the things it does it ensures that basic `git config` is uniform across my machines:
- https://github.com/jokeyrhyme/dotfiles/blob/master/packages/git-config.sh

Note that I can't just wholesale clone configuration files like this between machines, because there are still machine-specific details (e.g. OS X and Linux directory structure is different, etc).

Thankfully, I can just use the [`git config`](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration) CLI command to specifically set the common values and leave everything else alone.

Is this something that would be welcomed in a PR or otherwise developed for Atom? I can't just clone my entire `.atom/config.cson` file between machines, due to machine-specific settings. And I'd write my own CLI tool for manipulating CSON, but that seems brittle in the event that Atom's configuration structure changes.

```

That should ensure that only lsb core module is required, nothing else. I tested this in Fedora 21 (`sudo yum install 'lsb-core-noarch'`) and in OpenSUSE 13.2 (`sudo zypper install 'lsb-core-noarch'`) and it seems to work just fine.

"1088","Enable packages to intercept click events on the editor","Currently, we don't have a good story for enabling packages to handle click events in the editor, that I know of. How should we do this?
- One idea is to enable packages to register click event handlers for the lines and the gutters. For every click, their handler would be invoked. They would need a way to tell us not to continue processing the event. Do they call `stopImmediatePropagation` on the event? Return a boolean from their handler?
- @maxbrunsfeld mentioned in #6843 something even more general based on commands. Max if you have more thoughts on that maybe you could edit this and add them here?

"1101","Indentation glitch in certain scopes but not others.","Hey there! I've just noticed a somewhat strange glitch in how Atom responds to <kbd>Tab</kbd> in certain scopes---in particular Markdown, but I haven't cycled through them all yet. Setting the tab length to four spaces, either in `.gfm.source` or globally, causes Atom to insert four spaces but visually snap the cursor back to the middle of the tabstop, roughly two spaces in. From there, typing causes the cursor to jump back and insert text at the expected position about half of the time, and about half the time to drop text right where it appears to be, with two spaces before the insertion and two spaces trailing it. This also happens when I type four spaces the old-fashioned way.

I dropped a quick screencast demonstrating the hiccup at https://cloudup.com/cUq4wn72BsS. It was recorded with a brand-new, untampered-with Atom setup: I reinstalled the binary to be safe, and moved my `~/.atom` folder out of `$HOME`. The same behavior occurred, both without any third-party packages present and in safe mode.

So far I can attest that this _doesn't_ happen in plain-text mode, in Python, or with the scopes created by the `language-latex` package, but I can't generalize beyond that yet.

Please let me know if I can provide any more or any better information about the problem! And thanks in advance for your help.

"1109","load $PATH when launched as an app","When Atom is launched as an application, it doesn't get the user's PATH, because it was launched by `launchctl`. This means that packages like [script](https://github.com/rgbkrk/atom-script) and [hydrogen](https://github.com/willwhitney/hydrogen) have to tell the user to launch Atom from the command line. Some packages (like hydrogen) can't even be installed without the PATH because their dependencies use native extensions built with [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp). There exist tools such as [`fix-path`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fix-path), but they clobber the user's PATH even if they've set something on purpose (with e.g. a virtualenv).

Having access to the user's PATH will become more and more important as people build packages that interface more deeply with languages, other tools, and the user's environment. Forcing the user to configure each package with complete paths to the binaries it needs is possible, but inelegant, and becomes intractable with general-purpose tools.

This seems like a clear situation where making this change to Atom itself would dramatically simplify life for many packages and eliminate many bugs arising from poor attempts to capture the PATH.

This is a problem for me personally because. `ctrl` + `left`/`right` is the key combo used to switch between spaces. And my keyboard's arrow buttons are a single square directional button. Which often results in my space switching between browser and Atom to be a combination of both a horizontal and vertical `ctrl` + arrow keypress.

OSX doesn't switch focus away from Atom till after it has finished transitioning to the other space. Because of this I'll often find myself switching away from Atom. Then switching back to find an edited file with an extra square sitting next to my cursor.

When you click on the deprecation notice text in the status bar, you are taken to this screen:

![screen shot 2015-05-25 at 10 55 40 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25/7800595/a39f238e-02cc-11e5-8864-90a7e4d5bf04.png)

This screen feels unnecessary to anyone _using_ Atom.  Unless I'm a developer or I'm specifically trying to debug packages, I'm not too concerned with what methods in what packages are deprecated.  I would like the deprecation message to go away so I can get back to work.  How can Atom help me do that?  Could the ""Check for updates"" step happen automatically?  Could updates be installed during relaunch or during idle time?
#### Package updates

![screen shot 2015-05-25 at 11 07 37 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25/7800708/52e0e5fc-02ce-11e5-86ca-9e0fb9bc78df.png)

There's 1 update available.  When I click the notice in the status bar, I'm taken to this screen that runs an additional check for updates and then lists the packages that have updates.  Does Atom need to run this check again since it knows I have a package that needs an update already? 
#### Some considerations

In the spirit of GitHub Zen, here are a few things to consider:
- Atom should strive to not block content for non-fatal errors. 
- Atom should strive to keep notifications to a minimum.
- Atom should strive to reduce manual administrative overhead (updating packages, atom, etc.).

I see that middle button scrolling is possible in various places, e.g. in the `tree-view` component,  so I'm guessing that this default behavior (at least on Windows) was somehow blocked on the text editor. From what I've managed to understand so far, [this](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/75d02cdbc92b4ed5ef0139a4abe24fddd8d0e397/src/text-editor-component.coffee#L369) is the line responsible for it.

"1130","More flexible open path location parameters?","When you open an Atom path you can optional include an initialLine and initialColumn using the following syntax:

```
/my/path/to/open/test.txt:<line>:<column>
```

During the opening process those line,column values are stripped off the path and provided as metadata to the workspace opener handler. This is useful, but the problem is that the syntax is fixed, no other values can be passed in other then line, column.

I would like Atom to also read in URL query parameter syntax and send those values through as options to the workspace opener. I don't mean we should break the existing syntax for line column, but instead provide an alternative syntax using query parameter syntax.

For example these would all be equivalent:

```
/my/path/to/open/test.txt:10:1
/my/path/to/open/test.txt:10?initialColumn=1
/my/path/to/open/test.txt?initialLine=10&initialColumn=1
```

The reason for making this change is because then other workspace openers could could read in similar values that apply to them. For example I have an outliner editor (https://atom.io/packages/foldingtext-for-atom) that can filter the outline view with a search. I would like the option to provide an initial search value when opening an outline file, similar to how initial line and column is now provided to the default editor. If query parameter options were available in Atom I could then open a path like this:

```
/my/path/to/open/test.ftml?search=stuff
```

And `search: stuff` would get passed through to my opener as an option.

The implementation would be pretty strait forward:
1. In `atom-application.coffee::locationForPathToOpen` strip and store query parameters key values from the path right before the code that does: `pathToOpen = pathToOpen.replace(/[:\s]+$/, '')`.
2. Include those key values along with the initialLine and initialColumn key values that are being returned.
3. In `window-event-handler.coffee` process the `open-locations` handler a bit differently so that all location metadata gets passed through to `atom.workspace.open` instead of just the line and column.

"1131","API request: file created event","Hi,

I have created a function to watch changes in the project by a given pattern.
Due to the usage of patterns, I'm forced to use the `::onDidChange` of the individual files. 
The problem is, that I'm not able to fetch the file created events this way.
I could watch the directory and refresh all watchers on each change, but I would prefer
either a own event like `::onFileCreated` or some parameters passed to the callback of `::onDidChange`, so I can filter the created events

This is far from high priority, but maybe it is easy to implement?
I have looked into the `PathWatcher` and I think this feature could be implemented in this [line](https://github.com/atom/node-pathwatcher/blob/v4.4.0/src/main.coffee#L96) ?

We should have one API with, most importantly, **one** keybinding to be used to view or preview _any_ file type. So no matter what the active file is, if I hit <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+P</kbd> (for example) the registered viewer for that file type opens up in a new pane. If more than one viewer for that file type is registered, you can select the default one ... or press, for example, <kbd>Shift+Ctrl+Alt+P</kbd> to bring up a viewer list and select one.
## Requirements

- **MUST** allow packages to register viewers by scope name using the services API
- **MUST** offer a command `file-viewer:open` to open the single (or default) registered viewer for the file in the active editor (or selected file in the tree-view)
- **MUST** offer a command `file-viewer:listViewers` to open the list of registered viewers for the file in the active editor (or selected file in the tree-view)
- **SHOULD** allow the single (or default) registered viewer to be opened for files that do not have an ""opener"" registered, such as image, archive or audio types
- **OPTIONAL** offer a hex viewer as an option for all file types (see the [hex package](https://atom.io/packages/hex) for an awesome example)
## Questions
- When preview tabs are enabled, how should viewer tabs behave?
  - Should they be preview tabs? Only sticking around permanently if the tab title is double-clicked?
  - Should they be permanent tabs?
  - Should they be preview tabs, but of their own class so only other preview tabs override them?

Setting the `overflow` CSS property of the class `status-bar .status-bar-right` from `auto` to `hidden` fixes the issue, but I'm not sure if this rule serves some other purpose. The theme I'm using is the One Light UI but it might carry over to others as well.

"1147","Keymaps file is a hot mess to deal with.","At the end of the day a user has to track down where and what needs to be overriden and it makes it hard considering there are a lot of things that scope in a lot of places, right now my keymaps file has 6 different selectors to override a few short keybindings I don't like.

Could we please get an easier way for users to override keymaps in that we shouldn't have to track everything down, \* should override all (which it currently doesn't at all...) and can the keymaps file support sub-selectors as a sub-key on the cson?

Here, let me clarify:

``` cson
""*""
  ""ctrl-:"": ""comment-headers:insert""
```

The above should override anything that wants to use ctrl+shift+; but it doesn't, I have to scope under "".platform-linux atom-text-editor"" but then things become a mess because in order to override ""pageup"" and ""pagedown"" I have to scope under "".platform-linux"", which means I have two similar keys but one with an added scope.

Now I could be doing it wrong but when I tested with sub-selectors in the CSON it didn't work and neither did just doing ""*"".  It would be nice if this could be sorted out because users are used to working in specific ways so it becomes a side-job to manage a keybinding that has so many different scopes in so many different places.

"1154","scrolling behavior while mouse-selecting whole lines of text is hard to control","Atom v.0.196.0
Mac OS X 10.10.3

Trying to select text that spans more than just the visible scroll region is much more difficult in Atom than in other editors when selecting entire lines because of the auto-scrolling behavior.  When you stretch a selection past the edge of the scroll region, the editor scrolls to accommodate you, but once you overshoot your destination, pulling back starts scrolling back in the other direction even though it's not necessary.  Most other editors will only scroll when necessary.

Steps:
1. open a file that is at least twice as long as what you can display in your window
2. make sure you're scrolled to the top
3. triple-click and hold somewhere to begin selecting entire lines
4. drag down just past the bottom of the window, causing the window to scroll
5. once you've scrolled all the way to the bottom (it's important here that you scroll at least past the point where the top of the selection scrolls out of the window), pretend you overshot the bottom of what you wanted selected by a few lines and you actually want the selection to end at the 10th line from the bottom of the file.  continue to hold the mouse button down while you move your mouse back up to that line.
6. observe that if you move your mouse up past about the 4th line from the bottom of the window, it actually starts scrolling back up and will keep going until the top of your selection is visible.  This makes it difficult to get the selection to stop on a specific line because you have to time the scrolling to get your target line within 4 lines of the bottom of the window.

Expected: after mouse movement downward causes a scroll, moving the mouse back up into the window should not cause scrolling back in the other direction unless you attempt to move the end of the selection past the top of the visible part of the file.

"1155","Show invisibles only when selecting text","I tried searching for a similar issue here and I didn't find anything that directly addresses what I want, though #3249 (which I have subscribed to) is what I want, just asked for in a very roundabout way.

In short: we should have an option to only display invisibles within a selection. Showing them all the time is too noisy, not showing them at all loses their power, and turning them off and on when I want to see them is annoying. I'm aware that with CSS we cannot achieve what is required (hence unresolved #3249, and accompanying [forum post](https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-is-so-powerful-that-it-blows-my-mind/294/17?)) due to the underlayer controlling the background highlight. So this will presumably be something that atom must provide from within the core.

If this request appeals more as something that's more generic (and allow us to achieve what we want with CSS) you could actually just attach a `.selected` class to all elements (scopes) that are within the selection (obviously a selection part-way through an element will require an inner span injected with just the `.selected` class). This way, we can do what we want in regards to the invisibles, but package developers may find interesting ways to use this selection class/scope for other purposes.

Sublime remembers the cursor position per tab/file, so that when you go back to a tab, the cursor is at the position where you left off, and you can start typing right away.

"1159","Autoindent not working properly","Version: 0.192.0
## Problem

1) `autoindent` fails to indent parameter lists. Note: If I hit enter after `fake_function(`, `param=` would be indented 3x -- class > def > foo.

``` python
class Bar(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_indentation(self):
        foo = fake_function(param='hello',
        second_param='world', # should have indented this line
        ) # and this one, too
```

After saving, `atom-beautify` correctly indents the parameters

``` python
class Bar(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_indentation(self):
        foo = fake_function(param='hello',
                            second_param='world', # fixed!
                            ) # me, too!
```

2) But now, `autoindent` fails to reset indentation back to the beginning of the line

``` python
        [...]
        foo = fake_function(param='hello',
                            second_param='world',
                            )

                            bar = 'after_continuing typing' # ach!!
```

Unfortunately `atom-beautify` doesn't quite fix this ever time.

``` python
        foo = fake_function(param='hello',
                            second_param='world',
                            )

From the Chrome profiling tools, you can see that all of the `<progress>` elements are being redrawn continuously while this CSS is being applied. Once it is removed, the CPU usage goes back down to zero and the redraw ends.

Outright removing this style only affects the display of indeterminate progress bars, as they appear to be designed to have a ""barber poll"" animation.

Something should be done so that package developers who introduce the use of a `<progress>` element do not inadvertently burn CPU.

This was the goal of the existing package `file-mode` but that package is severely broken and a total rewrite is needed.  The ruby grammar already has this feature [built-in](https://github.com/atom/language-ruby/pull/90) but my package will work for all grammars.

I have a problem that the grammars are loaded asynchronously and a texteditor can be loaded before all the grammars are loaded.  See my issue #6586.  I can find the mode comment when the texteditor is loaded but there is no way to look up the grammar.

For now I'll kludge it and not look for the grammar list until after a time delay but this will cause the user to see the grammar switch after that delay which is not a good UX.

To finally get to the point, I need an event telling me when the grammars are loaded.  I'll wait until then to look in all the files for the mode comments.

If a command isn't bound to a focused element or its parent elements, then it should be disabled (and maybe also removed from the Command Palette?

"1183","Scroll veneer + selection = odd behavior","I posted about this on the discussion boards (https://discuss.atom.io/t/automatic-scroll-disable/16460).

It has been reproduced in `--safe`!
1. Start a new file and add enough text to allow for scrolling vertically.
2. Scroll to the very top of the file.
3. Try to select the last two lines on the screen.

It appears that the scroll veneer takes over and starts to move the screen into view. But because you are still down there, it continues to apply and selects while scrolling rapidly, which is hard to control. This also happens at the top of the screen and must be within the 3 edge lines for the issue to happen.

I'm in a nVidia driver hell since upgrading to Ubuntu 15.04, and though Chrome's `--disable-gpu` does prevent it from crashing my whole system, Atom's (0.196) `editor.useHardwareAcceleration` doesn't, ending in a rather painful way: cursor jitter, screen flickering, regular keyboard/mouse input loss, impossible to switch to a non-X tty → restart with [REISUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key).

Is there a workaround or a way to be more drastic about disabling gpu acceleration like the Chrome flag does? Or is it too antagonistic to improving performance?

"1191","Confusing behavior of Cursor.getCurrentWordBufferRange()","I have a very simple file containing nothing but the text `-12`.
When I execute the `getCurrentWordBufferRange()`-method on this text with the cursor on different positions of the text I get 3 different results:
- ""-"" cursor position [0,0]
- ""-12"" cursor position [0,1]
- ""12"" cursor position [0, 2]

Is this really the expected behaviour of `getCurrenWordBufferRange()`? I would expect it to always return the string `""-12""` or at least not different results for the same word.

"1197","""Unhandled promise rejection"" no longer shows up in the console.","This is a regression. Up to and including Atom v0.188.0, if you had code like:

``` coffee
setTimeout(

you would discover your error via the following in the console:

```
Unhandled promise rejection Promise
     __proto__: Promise
    [[PromiseStatus]]: ""rejected""
    [[PromiseValue]]: ""haha rejected""
```

which you could use to help debug your issue.

As of Atom v0.189.0, you see nothing. You can have chains and chains of `Promise.then()`, and if there is a failure in the middle, you now have no idea and have to start adding `.catch()` calls everywhere. It's madness.

I don't know what specifically causes the change, but here's what I have discovered thus far:
- Atom v0.189.0 (Apr 1) is built on atom-shell v0.22.3 (Mar 29) whereas Atom v0.188.0 (Mar 24) is built on atom-shell v0.21.3 (Mar 3).
- atom-shell v0.22.0 mentions **Upgrade to Chrome 41** in its release notes.
- https://github.com/iojs/io.js/pull/758 is a PR with a massive history, which I will not even to pretend to have read, but I believe it was closed on Feb 24 and it includes the following text in its initial comment:

> Implement unhandled rejection tracking for promises as

"1198","Selecting text with option + shift + arrow behaves differently to other Mac apps","Atom doesn't seem to follow Mac convention in certain cases. To reproduce:
1. Double click to highlight a word

- In atom, the selection is cleared and the cursor is now at the start of the original word.

Similarly, if the 2. is replaced with command + shift + left arrow, in Atom the extended selection doesn't include the originally selected word as it would in other apps.

Let's say we create a Decoration on a certain Marker. This Marker spans buffer rows 2-3.
Row 0 is then folded, and let's say this collapses buffer rows 0-5.

<b>What We Expect</b>
The Decoration should not be visible at all, because buffer rows 2-3 are entirely contained within the collapsed range.

<b>Actual Behavior</b>
The `decoration.getMarker().getScreenRange()` returns row 0 (i.e. the row that rows 2-3 were collapsed into), which indicates that the Decoration should be visible on screen at row 0.

<b>Possible Solutions</b>
In discussion with @nathansobo, it seems like changing `Marker::getScreenRange` to return null in this situation is not a viable option now, because that's likely to break many packages.
One solution could be to add a `visibleOnScreen` property to `Marker`.

https://discuss.atom.io/t/starting-atom-via-command-line-does-not-launch-it-correctly/16279/2

I recently tried to run atom portable. I would like to keep all my themes and packages on the drive as well, so I created a .atom folder on my flash drive using `md .atom`. After that, I extracted the latest zip distribution of Atom into an `Atom` folder on my flash drive. To set `ATOM_HOME` and launch atom, I used the following script:

```
@echo off
set ATOM_HOME= ""E:/.atom""
start E:/Atom/atom.exe --safe
echo ATOM_HOME currently at %ATOM_HOME%
echo.
pause
```

When trying to run this script, I got

```

```

The rest of the stack trace can be found at the above link. Oddly, after I `REM`ed out the `set ATOM_HOME= ""E:/.atom""`, atom launched fine from the flash drive. Is there anyway this can be fixed?

"1217","suppressing autoscroll, or saving/restoring current scroll position","In ae4f7f6170da83c786ba06235f0997e52e806b10, a global autoscroll suppression mechanism was removed in favour of a per-call `autoscroll` option.

In vim-mode, motions get combined with operations, and the _yank_ operation which copies text into clipboard should not always scroll around. However, there currently seems to be no way of preventing generic cursor movements from autoscrolling.

@nathansobo suggested adding the `autoscroll` option in the various movement methods, so I'm looking at this. It seems it will require that every method that may move the cursors to accept and pass through an options parameter; that feels like an unnecessarily wide-reaching contract, which affects not only methods in Atom core, but also in any package that has actions that can move the cursor.

Further, some methods like `Selection.selectLine` and `Selection.insertText` currently simply assume `autoscroll` should be true, and all places like this would need to be revisited.

@nathansobo and @maxbrunsfeld - there was a `Editor.suppressAutoscroll` option in the code, introduced in 99c437ccecff469d2fc4ba70ff3ff9a0f694f9e6 and removed again in ae4f7f6170da83c786ba06235f0997e52e806b10 - can you please clarify the reasoning there? I'm sure I'm missing something.

Alternatively, is there a public API for getting and setting the current scroll position of the window? If so, vim-mode's _yank_ operation could use that.

"1226","Replace Bootstrap CSS with hand-written CSS designed for Atom","The bootstrap CSS is enormous. It is designed to solve a problem that Atom does not have. That is, a set of CSS rules to normalize presentation across all browsers that may be used for rendering, using whatever browser-specific hacks necessary to achieve that goal.

The project was also conceived before the advent of flexbox, which means that bootstrap has a ton of cruft to deal with pre-flexbox browsers. Such workarounds are verbose and make it difficult to understand what can be removed.

In sum, this puts Atom into a situation where:
- The CSS is much larger than what Atom needs.
- It requires much more work than should be necessary to understand why the current CSS works the way it does.
- Bootstrap is the source of truth, rather than something that is directly under Atom's control.

For example, take a look at the issue I recently filed against Bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/16276. The recommended solution is to pile on another hack (i.e., use an even more specific CSS selector) rather than figure out why the existing CSS works the way it does and fix the underlying problem with the model. Presumably this is because trying to untangle why things work the way they do is too hard.

Atom should not be saddled with the baggage of layout engines of old and should be exploiting the fact that it only needs to support Blink (which supports flexbox), and write its own small, specific, and far more maintainable CSS.

"1233","Mini editor keybindings don't match native text input keybindings","In particular in a native text field (OS X anyway) I can use Up/Down to move or select to the start/end of my text field. These keybindings/commands ARE properly implemented in the standard TextEditor, it just looks like they've been intentionally left out of the mini editor. In particular if you look in `text-editor-element.coffee` you'll see:

```
atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor:not([mini])', stopEventPropagation(
  'core:move-up': -> @moveUp()
  'core:move-down': -> @moveDown()
  'core:move-to-top': -> @moveToTop()
  'core:move-to-bottom': -> @moveToBottom()
...
```

I think the following commands should be included in the mini editor to match native behavior:

```
  'core:move-up': -> @moveUp()
  'core:move-down': -> @moveDown()
  'core:move-to-top': -> @moveToTop()
  'core:move-to-bottom': -> @moveToBottom()
  'core:select-up': -> @selectUp()
  'core:select-down': -> @selectDown()
  'core:select-to-top': -> @selectToTop()
  'core:select-to-bottom': -> @selectToBottom()
```

Does this seem like a reasonable change? If so I can make a pull request, just asking first since these seem to have been explicitly disabled in the mini editor.

"1237","Character positioning/cursor movement breaks with certain emoji characters","Atom 0.190.0, OS X 10.10
Enter some random emoji, such as :ocean::eyes::relieved:, then add :m: to the end, the preceding characters move and overlap and the cursor position gets weird.

Seems to only happen with :m:, but I haven't tried everything.

I think it's something to do with variation selectors. When you enter :m: using the OS X emoji palette, it encodes as `e2 93 82 ef b8 8f`, or `CIRCLED LATIN CAPITAL LETTER M` followed by `VARIATION SELECTOR 16`. If you copy and paste just `CIRCLED LATIN CAPITAL LETTER M` it works fine.

It demonstrates a weird issue with `getBoundingClientRect` method results.
I have put logs in the method that positions the quick settings menu of the minimap, when in the function the returned bounds object has a negative top offset (which is not what it should return).
When calling the same method on the same object from the console, I get a different, but now correct result. 
I can't say when exactly it started doing this but I'm guessing it started with the update to chrome 41.

Anyone has an idea why `getBoundingClientRect` act this way?

"1243","Allow a location option when adding menu items","Right now when you add menu items they get inserted at the bottom of the specified menu. I would like to have some optional way to the specify a location when inserting menu items. From what I can tell this isn't possible now. Is anyone working on this already? If not and I create a solution what are the chances that I can get it merged into Atom?

My basic design would follow how I think Eclipse solves this problem. Haven't actually used Eclipse for years, but I think the basic idea is: Give each item an optional ""location"" attribute that's used to determine where the item is inserted relative to existing item IDs in the menu.

The ID of existing menu items would be an ""ID"" attribute if found, otherwise it would fallback to using ""label"", though that's problematic if menus will ever be localized.

The set of locations specifiers would be:

`location=""top""` - The item will be inserted at the top of the menu.

`location=""bottom""` - The item will be inserted at the bottom of the menu.

`location=""before:id""` - The item will be inserted before the existing item with matching ID.

`location=""after:id""` - The item will be inserted after the existing item with matching ID.

`location=""endof:id""` - The item will be inserted at the end of the separator group with matching ID. (this means it will be inserted right before the next separator group starts.

"1256","Atom Editor Doesn't Come to Foreground","Hi,

My OS is Ubuntu 14.10. I use Unity as my window manager. Atom version is 0.188.0. 

If I open a file from Nautilus file manager by pressing ""Enter"" or by double-clicking, Atom often doesn't come to foreground. (Its icon wobbles in Unity dashboard.) To see it, I have to switch to Atom manually. Only after that, I can work on the file. 

I made some tests. It happens when Atom is already open and if I use Alt+Tab key combination. If I never use Alt+Tab to switch between windows, then there's no problem. Otherwise, first I've to open file, then manually switch to Atom window. Unfortunately It's inefficinet way to work.

What I want is, Atom should always come to foreground, if I open a file. Is there a workaround or a patch for this problem?

Kind regards,

Hi! 
I noticed a bug when selecting 7 or more lines with multiple cursors. In the gif above, I press ctrl-alt-down 7 times, then once shift-right to select the numbers, then ctrl-c to copy, then esc to go back to 1 cursor. When I press ctrl-v on an empty line, the just copied numbers are shuffled.

But in Atom this doesn't happen. Instead the selection extends to the column based on the mouse x position, even when the mouse y position is above the text editor. (Atom does correctly handle the case (set selection to end of text) when the mouse extends below the text editor... it's only the above case that's not working correctly).

"1269","Folding toggle command","Hi,

Currently Atom has 2 different commands for folding/unfolding the current row: 
1. editor:fold-current-row 
2. editor:unfold-current-row

But it seems more logical to have just one row folding toggle command, and use to fold/unfold a block.

This is more like a feature request, it seems that both Atom and SublimeText are missing this, and Visual Studio gets it right. The fold all behaviour of Atom is much better than Sublime's though.

Thank you.

"1273","Rename / Disable ""Reopen Last Item""","Suggestions:
1. Disable ""Reopen Last Item"" until a document has been closed.
2. Rename ""Reopen Last Item"" to ""Reopen Closed Document""

Justification:
In the absence of a ""Open Recent..."", the wording of the ""Reopen Last Item"" menu option is confusing. Nearly every time I use Atom as a new user, I launch Atom and go to File > Reopen Last Item. It doesn't do anything. See #5718.

As I understand it, it seems to actually be more similar to a browser's ""Reopen Closed Tab"", no? Chrome has ""Reopen Closed Tab"". Until this is made moot by #4241, we should rename that menu item to ""Reopen Closed Document"" or something to that effect.

Part of the confusion is that ""Reopen Last Item"" has the same placement as the standard ""Open Recent..."" menu option, but they don't operate the same way. We should disable it until Atom is in a state where the menu item actually does anything.

"1276","Add Root Folder from command line","The tree-view command ""Add Root Folder"" is very useful. Frequently I want to open multiple projects in one editor window, with each project as a root folder. This enables things like tree-view's ""Hide VCS Ignored Files"" to actually work. Other packages also require the root of a repository to be a root folder in tree-view, such as git-blame, for example. Currently, opening a directory from the command line results in opening a new Atom editor window.

``` shell
atom /foo/bar # creates new window with /foo/bar the single root folder in tree-view
atom /foo/baz # creates another window
```

I have a feeling issue atom/tree-view#393 would block implementing a feature like this, but it would be very nice to support something like the following.

``` shell
atom /foo/bar # creates new window with /foo/bar the single root folder in tree-view
atom -a /foo/baz # adds /foo/baz as a root folder to an existing window (most recently used?)
```

"1277","Atom should save new files where the last opened/saved file was","When you create a new buffer and hit save, Atom will present me with a save dialog and the default selected folder is the project root. That's almost never the place I want to put a file.

Sublime Text was a lot smarter with this -- although I do not remember the exact heuristics. For example, it would propose saving the file in the same location where the file you last had opened was. This worked really well for me: Usually I create a new file by splitting an existing file, creating a test for a module (and those two are in directly adjacent directories) or similar.

Even if I want to save to the root directory, which is the current behavior, navigating upwards in the file save dialog is really simple.

"1280","Wrong conversion from screen to pixels and screen to buffer with soft wrap enabled","A screenshot is more telling so let's start here:

This is the only wrapped line of the file. As you can see, when querying the pixel position for the first column of the first line after the text wrap, the pixel position is still the one of the last char of the line above. This is true for every columns of the hanging indent (see the screenshot below). I guess the issue comes from the handling of the hanging indent, but the result shouldn't be a position at the end of the line above anyway.

![color-marker-element-spec_coffee_-__users_cedric_github_pigments_-_atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/247140/6770769/35679794-d0cb-11e4-912b-95831c192dff.png)

But, it's not the only problem, converting position from the screen to the buffer space coordinates gives also weird result:

![color-marker-element-spec_coffee_-__users_cedric_github_pigments_-_atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/247140/6770718/7bc4199e-d0c9-11e4-8741-6554240be401.png)

"1281","Incremental find","Here's another Sublime Text feature Atom doesn't have that Sublime users may miss.

{`Cmd`,`Ctrl`} + `i` starts an incremental find, which works like {`Cmd`,`Ctrl`} + `f` but jumps to the first match as you type and closes when you hit enter.

It's great for quickly getting to a different part of the file.

"1282","Indicator to control per-document indentation options","Atom needs an indicator in the lower right displaying the current spaces/tabs setting for the document. Which should also give access to options that control the per-document indentation settings.

Attempting to auto detect indentation is fine. But for a developer that works on projects all over, indentation practices are anything but reliable. User, syntax, and project settings just don't cut it for picking up a random library, making a small tweak, and then submitting it. Changing the per-document settings should be a few quick clicks.

This is standard in other editors like Atom. And I find it is used even more often than the encoding indicator Atom has already added.

I had the unexpected experience of trying to correct the spaces in a small spot of a file and finding that not only were the leading spaces elsewhere in that file converted, but spaces in the middle of the line that were used for `=>` alignment were converted into tabs (and into the wrong number of tabs).
","enhancement"
"1284","Tab length spaces are treated as tabs","My settings have `tab spaces` set to 4. I also have `soft tabs` enabled - as well as `Show invisibles` so I can see that spaces are being inserted instead of tabs.

That's good, it appears 4 spaces have been inserted. Now if I hit the left key, I'm taken to the start of the line (and not back one space).
![left-arrow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1747643/6747454/b5721a80-cf2d-11e4-8e1f-2bc29afbd729.png)

Similarly if I try and highlight one of those spaces with my mouse, I can only highlight all or nothing of the 4 spaces.

In other editors I use (gedit, brackets), the behaviour I've found is that backspace, or left, will only go back one character, not the whole 4 (or what's configured) spaces.

"1288","Update should disable the package in all open atom windows","Currently it only disables it _only_ in the window where you click the update button. 
# Motivation

Atom-TypeScript runs a separate atom instance (as node) in the background to do the heavy lifting away from the UI thread. We kill this background worker if we get deactivated. 
- _The happy case:_ This means if you only have one atom window open, and run update : the worker is stopped and the files can be deleted and updated by apm. 
- **The issue:** If you have two atom windows open we will have two workers (one with each atom instance). If you start an update in one atom window, the worker will still be running for the other atom window and therefore apm will fail to delete the directory. Furthermore it will delete just enough to leave the whole plugin unusable.

"1294","Add option for hanging indent for soft-wrapped lines.","Please consider adding an option for hanging indents for soft-wrapped lines. It's really helpful for identifying wrapped lines, especially for languages like LaTeX where lines tend to be long and frequent editing makes manual hard wrapping needlessly tedious.

Example (adapted from @AlexLog's nicely-done example from Discuss): 

``` latex

% Current behavior
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aaaa aaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa
    aaa aaaa aaaaaa aaa.
    \item Aaaa aaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa
    aaa aaaa aaaaaa aaa.
\end{itemize}

% Proposed behavior with 4-space hanging indent specified
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aaaa aaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa
        aaa aaaa aaaaaa aaa.
    \item Aaaa aaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa
        aaa aaaa aaaaaa aaa.
\end{itemize}

```

I'd add a variable to the soft wrap indent formula whose value is added to the indent level of the first line. By default, the value could be zero. In the UI, it should be on the `Settings` tab below `Tab Length` and named `Soft Wrap Hanging Indent`. If it uses a dropdown list like `Tab Length`, the options could be the same as the tab length options with the default zero option added.

While it could be designed as adding a configurable number of tab stops, it may be simpler to just make it a number of spaces, as there may be people who want a hanging indent level to be distinct from tab stops. Since the default would be zero, any level would have to be configured, so the number of spaces option would be no more configuration effort and more flexible.

"1297","Enable jumping between menus using left-right arrow keys","If there is no sub-menu to a menu-entry, I would like to switch to the next menu when I press the left/right arrow keys. Also when I'm on the last nesting level in a sub-menu, I'd like to switch to the next main menu entry. If the said feature already exists it does not work for me on Ubuntu 14.04 using Atom version 0.187.0.

To clarify what I'm saying:

![zhhmfqqzcz](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5445560/6683412/0d669cf4-ccac-11e4-9181-398ea6be26e8.png)

In the above scenario, I would like to be able to switch to the ""Selection"" menu when I press the right arrow key, other than when I press it on the ""developer"" menu-entry, which will open the sub-menu like it already does. However, inside the developer sub-menu also pressing the right arrow key does not take me to ""Selection"".

~~Another such issue is that once I've opened a menu with ""alt+ "", say ""View"" with alt+V, I'm not able to open selection with ""alt+S"" unless I close the view menu first.~~

Thanks.

**EDIT**:- It's UbuntuMATE 14.04, so I'm in a MATE-desktop environment.

If there is an [TextEditor API](https://atom.io/docs/api/v0.187.0/TextEditor) method usually comes in both the screen and the buffer ""falvor"", but for [setTextInBufferRange](https://atom.io/docs/api/v0.187.0/TextEditor#instance-setTextInBufferRange) there is only the buffer version. 

Because of this, I have to convert all my coordinates to buffer coordinates, whereas editor coordinates made more sense and it was more convenient in this case.

Why is there no setTextInScreenRange ? Is the documentation incomplete? Is there a reason behind this ? Or will this probably be added later on ?

"1300","The insanity of Unicode's ""RTL override""","This is a bug report mostly based on [this neat article](http://habrahabr.ru/post/252813/). I'll summarize the essence that relates to Atom, right here. Consider this snippet of Python:

``` python
def maps():
    print ""maps maps maps""

def spam():
    print ""Erasing everything...""
    print ""done.""

s = ""spam‮"" ,spam ,""‬spam""
# ^ attention to this line: try selecting it with your mouse
s[1]()
```

That line, properly escaped:

``` python
s = ""spam&#8238;"" ,spam ,""&#8236;spam""
```

The symbols of interest, in order of appearance, are `&#8238;` or RLO (right-to-left override) and `&#8236;` or PDF (pop directional formatting). They, respectively, reverse text direction and set it back.

Atom expands this combination just like a browser would, it actually displays that RLO-PDF piece in reverse. However, interaction with it is... awkward. Start with the fact that you can't (at least visually) move your cursor inside that gap in any way.

Look at this. With ""Plain text"" grammar on, I've selected that line:

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/q6KKB0M.png)

Noticed that? 10 units of extra space. Notice also, that between RLO and PDF are exactly 10 characters. That's a hint. However, once I switch on Python grammar (and RLO-PDF interval is now contained in multiple elements), things get even more awkward.

![Screenshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/QpOpCDm.png)

Not 10 units, as before. Now we have only 4. And from that moment, I don't have a slightest clue about what's going on, but something needs to be done about that.

This needs a discussion. I can immediately come up with these two general directions:
1. Interpret as designed in Unicode. Fix the UI, make the cursor work properly and not introduce gaps like the ones above.
2. Represent Unicode control characters with some sort of ""placeholders"" and don't let them act as designed in Unicode.

Personally, I stand for placeholders, as Atom is mostly a code editor, and code is a raw sequence of characters. It makes sense for Atom to display it as closely as possible to how the parser will see it.

In those cases when plain text is used to author a document that makes use of these sequences to display properly, ""preview"" plugins come into play and let you preview the document as it will look after processing.

Thoughts?

I went to the settings page to disable packages.  There were two problems ...

1) When I scroll down, go into settings for a package, I can't go back, can I?.  I have to click on packages again and start at the top.  This is a serious problem when you have 100 packages.

2) All enabled packages show the `Install` button which makes no sense.  And since there  is no `Settings` button I can't disable anything.

I'll use the command-line but that is a lot of typing. The above problems need fixing.

"1303","Support HTML-first workflow","Google Polymer takes an ""HTML-first"" approach to defining custom elements. Rather than calling a JavaScript method to register an element, you instead use a custom `<polymer-element>` tag to declare elements. The Polymer team had difficulty using this approach in Atom for a couple of reasons.
### Issues running inline scripts due to our content-security policy

This is the biggest hurdle. There's currently no way to white-list script tags in an imported HTML document. A content security policy can be associated with a nonce value that can be inserted into scripts to indicate they are runnable, and it would be nice if we could cascade this nonce through an HTML import to script tags in the imported content.
### Needing to manually insert HTML-imports into the `<head>`

This is easily solvable via a service that presents a function like `loadHTMLDocument(fullPath)`. I'd rather do it with `require`, but Node-style requires are expected to be synchronous and waiting for the imported content to load is async. This would therefore still require a tiny bit of boilerplate in `activate` to interact with the service and load the package's main document.

"1315","Configurable stylesheets through user-variables.less","We were having [this discussion](https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-allow-users-to-override-my-packages-less-variables/15243/7?u=braver) and jessegrosjean came up with the idea of a `user-variables.less` file.

There have been attempts to set Less variables through config and they have failed for various reasons. While config would be preferable for discovery and ease of use, if it doesn't work perhaps there is a another way.

Users can now overrule styles with their own stylesheet, but that's very limited. It's impossible to change the overall hue of let's say one-dark-ui because those colors are everywhere throughout the stylesheet and the selectors would just be insane. If you can change the variable however, it's just a single number.

The idea would be to have a user-variables.less file in addition to the syntax-variables and the ui-variables. Theme and package authors can choose where to place the import, thereby maintaining control over which variables can be changed by the user. What can be changed can be communicated in the package's readme. This doesn't change the user stylesheet behaviour and would be added in addition to that stylesheet.

So while I think we can agree this is not the ideal solution, the ideal solution being unavailable this could be a brilliant compromise that opens up a lot of options.

"1316","Make Windows shell integration opt-in via Settings","Hello all
we're on windows 7 64bits. After installing Atom, basically everywhere I right-click in windows explorer I see a ""Open with Atom"" item. We tried cleaning those many elements manually from registry, but at the next update of course they're back again.

How can we opt-out from the Winsows shell integration? Possibly at install time and, also, afterwards through some program preferences,

"1318","Implementing download accelerator into update functionality of Atom","Hi,

I'm just wonder anyway to implement a multi-threading download accelerator alike wget into update functionality of Atom editor. This will make the update process take less time to download rather than traditional update. Whenever I update Atom, I feel like it never complete.

Conclusion: A functionality that allows Atom to update itself including major and plugins with:
1. secure https download accelerator + 
2. integrity check (md5, sha512 hash).

How do you think about this?
Thanks for consideration.

"1319","Initial non-English character is multiplied inside automatically closed quotes","I can't explain this behaviour in words only, so here's the gif:

![weird](http://i.imgur.com/QiaT2vL.gif)

On line 2, I'm typing a single Russian letter '?', but it gets displayed many times in the string. If I press Backspace after that, the whole string of ?'s is erased.

Whatever I'm typing after the first letter is added to the end of the line after all the repetitions. I can delete the first letter, but then the next letter gets repeated etc. 

The only way to get rid of this is to break the line, but as soon as the closing quote is on the same line, weird behaviour reoccurs.

I've tried Japanese and Kazakh characters as well, with the same result.

My OS is Crunchbang Waldorf. I don't experience this issue in Atom for Windows.

"1344","Do something about UI pause when switching themes","Currently, when you switch themes in the settings view, there's no visual feedback and (at least in my case) the UI seems to briefly pause while it recomputes the styles. We could attack this a few ways, like;
- A spinner in the Themes section of the settings view
- A 30% opacity overlay  with a message over the _whole window_ while styles are recomputed (drastic, but changing the theme is a relatively drastic action that users won't do often)
- other?

"1345","Manual change of font size leads to visual frobnication in Atom 0.184","A recent build of Atom seems to have introduced a race condition when manually changing font size with `Cmd =` and `Cmd -`.

","bug"
"1346","Cursor.isInsideWord returns incorrect results if only whitespace is to the right of the cursor ","Discovered this while looking into https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5712

Steps to reproduce:

Paste this text into an editor (notice the whitespace after bar):

```
foo bar         
  baz
```

Put the cursor right after `bar` and run this in console:

```
> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].getBufferPosition()
Point {row: 0, column: 7, copy: function, negate: function, freeze: function…}

> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].isInsideWord()
true
```

Not what I expected. Now, put the cursor a few spaces to the right on the same line (so, it's _surrounded by whitespace, but not at the end of line):

```
> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].getBufferPosition()
Point {row: 0, column: 11, copy: function, negate: function, freeze: function…}

> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].isInsideWord()
true

> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].isSurroundedByWhitespace()
true
```

That can't be right -- a cursor can't be surrounded by whitespace _and_ be within a word.

Move the cursor all the way to the EOL:

```
> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].getBufferPosition()
Point {row: 0, column: 16, copy: function, negate: function, freeze: function…}

> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].isInsideWord()
true

> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].isSurroundedByWhitespace()
true
```

Same story.

Now, put a character at the end of the first line, so that the content is:

```
foo bar         1
  baz
```

Now put the cursor to the right of `bar` or between `bar` and `1`, and you'll get expected results:

```
> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].getBufferPosition()
Point {row: 0, column: 12, copy: function, negate: function, freeze: function…}

> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].isInsideWord()
false

> atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().cursors[0].isSurroundedByWhitespace()
true
```

This is tripping up some movement and selection commands (e.g. [getBeginningOfNextWordBufferPosition](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c9ce9f41c235d9b72a117ef4a682d1e63462e471/src/cursor.coffee#L553-L563)), but I'm not sure if it's the only thing tripping them up. Another thing I noticed is that the same method [doesn't pass `options` to the `wordRegExp()` call](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c9ce9f41c235d9b72a117ef4a682d1e63462e471/src/cursor.coffee#L559) like other methods do.

"1348","Let's choose a view framework for docs, generated packages, etc.","(This is an attempt to restate #3752, explain the current position and present options)
## A blessed view system for Atom

We're in an interesting place with respect to generating views in packages and core. We wrote [space-pen](https://github.com/atom/space-pen) and used it heavily, but ultimately decided to discontinue using it for new views ([though some base views still use space-pen](https://github.com/atom/atom-space-pen-views) we are no longer recommending it). So now we find ourselves in an unfortunate position of using the DOM APIs directly, and suggesting package authors do the same, choose a framework themselves, or ╮(. ? ᴗ ?.)╭ - Not a great place to be, and makes it hard to write docs with nice examples.

We used React in the editor component for six months or so, and it was a good experience, but it has a bit of a learning curve.

We experimented with a few things inspired by React and Polymer, and have done some research on 3rd-party view frameworks, but haven't come to a decision. As we work on better docs for the run up to 1.0, we have to start taking this seriously.
## Requirements
- Embrace modern browser features (custom elements, `Object.observe`, etc) as much as possible
- It absolutely does not pollute the global namespace
- Data-binding preferred to imperative updates if templates are used
- View model / MVVM-style separation of rendering and logic
- No dependencies on jQuery-like helper libs
- Small learning curve
  - somewhat self-explanatory when used in docs examples
  - in other words, most web developers will be able to recognize the concepts that are applied without reading a book on it
## Contenders / experiments
- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Etch](https://github.com/nathansobo/etch) - a library for writing HTML-based view components that provides the convenience of a virtual DOM while at the same time striving to be minimal, interoperable, and explicit - written by @nathansobo and @maxbrunsfeld 
- [rivets](http://rivetsjs.com/) for templating+data binding plus some basic JS object glue for Atom
- [television](https://github.com/atom/television) - ""Television aims to cleanly integrate the virtual DOM approach of React.js into HTML 5 custom elements."" - an experiment from @nathansobo
- [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) this library is used by `television`, but could be a component in a similar solution that accomplishes the above goals.
- [elmer](https://github.com/atom/elmer) - An experiment from @benogle based on Polymer's template binding
- [vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) - simple, component-based, simple & small
- Something custom, delightful & new from your friends the Atom team (but we don't reallllly want to maintain another view frameowrk)
## Want to help?

One way to help speed this along is to do some experimentation with using your favorite framework in a package. See https://github.com/benogle/template-explore as an example package using https://github.com/atom/elmer.

A couple questions I would try to answer with the package:
- How does it handle model/DOM updates? Data-binding? Imperative + virtual-dom like react?
- How does it handle events? i.e. How do I bind a click handler to an element?
- Can it work with `Object.observe` and not it's own model system?
- Does it inject _any_ globals?
- How does it interact with web components, both in terms of creating new ones and using existing components written using different frameworks?
## Discuss

We're interested in hearing the pros and cons of the various ways we can satisfy the items listed under requirements, recommendations for solutions we don't have listed, and questions about the reqs and how and why we arrived at them.

Also, I encourage @atom/core and maintainers to edit the Contenders section in the issue body as more come in, and let me know if I missed / misstated anything in Requirements

"1351","Failed to activate package - can we improve user notification ?","I am the developer of a package https://atom.io/packages/supercollider

Recently the package stopped working due to 6to5 raising an issue with unsafe use of eval in a dependency of a dependency of a dependency of atom-supercollider. Its functionality that is not even being used in atom-supercollider
1. The user isn't informed that the package failed to activate, has to look in console 
2. There is no report in the Packages pane for atom-supercollider
3. Developer (moi) who uses apm link does not experience this particular issue

For 1 I think that the nice red pop up panel should have been activated and allow the user to report the issue.

For 2 I suggest marking the package as ""failed to activate"" in some way. But maybe handling 1 is enough.

For 3: As a developer I was unaware that this was happening. I'm using the package with apm link so it doesn't get processed in the same way.  I had to unlink and then install it to see the error.

I can separate these issues if you want.

Error posted below. 

Its depd (which ironically is a package for reporting deprecations) which is in express which is used by supercollider.js (my npm module). Express isn't used by my atom package, so I can factor that functionality into a separate npm module.

"1356","Variable UI font-size","This issue acts as the ""umbrella"" for everything related to a variable UI font-size. Other related issues: https://github.com/atom/styleguide/pull/25, #4342, #3792,  https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/307, https://github.com/atom/atom-dark-ui/issues/24
#### Problem:

Unlike the Syntax font size, there isn't an easy way to change the font size for the UI.
#### Current options:

**1. Styles.less** Anything can be overridden in `styles.less`. Works great for tweaks in certain areas, but can't really be used to override all font sizes at once.

**2. Themes** Themes that are based on the `rem/em` units can be scaled by only changing the root element like `html { font-size: 14px; }`. To my knowledge, currently only [isotope-ui](https://atom.io/themes/isotope-ui) supports that.

**3. Zoom** It's possible to change the zoom level in `init.coffee`:

``` coffee
require('web-frame').setZoomFactor(2)
```

[See this discussion](https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-set-the-font-for-the-settings-ui-and-the-command-browser/13498/4). Works for all themes, but could have some px rounding issues.
#### Possible improvements (future):
1. Add a way to override Less variables from `styles.less`, themes and in the settings. There was an attempt but needs to be investigated further: https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4153#issuecomment-73980380 
2. Switch everything to `rem/em` based font units. But this won't happen for 1.0 since it might break existing themes, packages and people's `styles.less`. Maybe for 2.0 if overriding Less variables isn't possible till then.

"1357","Files are scrolled to top when updated externally","steps to reproduce
1. open a log file in atom
2. scroll part way down the file
3. add new line to end of log file with an external tool/editor and save
4. go back and view the log file in atom

expected
- log file is reloaded
- log file scroll position is still part way down (same as in step 2 above)

actual
- log file is reloaded (PASS)
- log file scroll position goes back to top (FAIL)

Every time a new line is added externally the editor reloads it (as it should) but it jumps to the top which makes it impossible to read log files while they're been written because atom constantly jump back to the top.

(sidenote: git clones still won't work and require proxy configuration in `$HOME/.gitconfig` or `$HOME/.ssh/config`.)

This is reallllllly complex, and AFAICT not documented anywhere. I cobbled together this information from:
- atom/atom-shell#584
- atom/atom#1807 (very helpful)
- atom/atom-shell#183

This ticket is about the following issues:
- Atom needs proxy config specified three ways (should only need to specify this data in once)
- There's no documentation of this process (steps should be mentioned in the manual)

Create a new PHP file and use doc_f snippet. You'll get a PHPDoc block which uses the recommended formatting - the asterisks are aligned vertically using an additional leading space.

When copy and pasting... this space is lost if you paste on an already indented line. ANIGIF below shows the reproduction, and shows that on an empty line it pastes OK, but on pasting with indentation the spaces aligning the asterisks are lost.

In case someone thinks aligning the asterisks is bad practice - it's actually customary for PHPDoc. See first glossary entry on the PHPDoc website:

Enough bitching and on to the problem.  When I had  the `atom-my-package` folder in `~/.atom/packages` then the package listed in settings was`atom-my-package`.  But the settings were saved under  `my-package` which is what was in `package.json`.  So settings didn't work until I renamed the folder `my-package`.

See the last half of the discussion at #5492. Here are the highlights:
- git clone an atom package locally
- change package.json ""main"" field to a non-exsistant file
- run apm install to bring in node_modules
- run apm link
- open atom

In the settings view, you will see the package under the `community packages` section. You can play with the settings and all activation commands are available. However, dispatching one of these commands silently fails with no output to the dev tools and as a side effect removes all of the package's activation commands from the command pallete. As further debugging you can reset atom and open the dev tools then:
- atom.packages.resolvePackagePath('my-package') => returns 'path/to/local/repo'
- atom.packages.activatePackage('my-package') => returns an object
- atom.packages.isPackageActive('my-package') => returns false

"1390","Moving the window of an unsaved tab should not prompt to save the document","Say you have two atom windows open. In one of the windows you have a tab with unsaved content. Right if you drag that tab from one atom window to the other, atom will prompt you to save the file. There's no reason for it to do this, the file's not being closed, nothing is being lost.

"1391","Title bar is not appropriate for non-project files","When a project is open (i.e. the file browser is open), if I open the LICENSE or other non-project file, then the title bar will show like:

> LICENSE -- /path/to/project

This is misleading because it implies that the `LICENSE` file is inside the /path/to/project when it is not. In fact... I have no idea where the hell LICENSE is. It would be better to have something else in the title bar. Recommendations are:
- `LICENSE`
- `Atom - LICENSE`
- `Atom - Version 0.179.0 - LICENSE`

Now, for example, when I open ""Open your Config"", the titlebar shows `config.cson -- /path/to/project`, I am unsure if this is a global config file or if the file is actually saved at /path/to/project/config.cson.

Command-Shift-Option-V (the default keyboard shortcut for Paste and Match Style) doesn't seem to work in Atom as a method to paste as plain text. 

Ideally, that keyboard shortcut would work the same way as it does in TextEdit (while TextEdit is in plain text mode).

**Language-csharp package appears twice**

After the [recent 0.178.0 release](https://atom.io/releases) (_Atom now includes C# syntax highlighting by default_), the language-csharp package appears twice in my ""Installed Package"" list - once under Community Packages, and once under Core Packages.

![fa75766fb9ca7157](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/517857/6182518/c6de7932-b388-11e4-8b62-4ff64ac6275c.png)

I manually disabled the Community Packages version, but there is no option to uninstall it.

I was able to manually delete the Community Packages version in `~/.atom/packages/languages-csharp` via command line, which is a temporary workaround to the problem.

Ideally, when a package is moved to Atom Core, the existing Community Package is uninstalled and settings are transferred to the Atom Core version.

Additional info: OS X 10.10.2, Atom 0.177.0/0.178.0

Thanks. :sparkles:

"1407","Using atom-text-editor in packages","For reference I've made a package to display all the standalone `atom-text-editor` permutations. https://github.com/atom/atom-text-editor-exercise

Currently using an `atom-text-editor` in a package as a replacement for `textarea` isnt that great:

``` html
<atom-text-editor>
    This editor
    grows
</atom-text-editor>
```

Produces:

A few issues
- It shows line numbers by default
- it shows invisibles if I have them enabled
- It grows by default
- The styling is not like the mini editors

Constraining height makes it behave a little more like a text area, but you need to set the height in the `style` attribute or the editor does weird things:

``` html
<atom-text-editor style=""height: 100px"">
  Some text
</atom-text-editor>
```

Produces (border added for clarity)

Also not great. It introduces something that is nice in the pane-item editor, but not in a textarea: you cant get close to the bottom of the editor with the cursor, there is always a 3 line padding. 

![editor-padding](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69169/6155421/1c83812c-b1e8-11e4-91ca-8bd62c44999f.gif)
### Proposal

I propose two new tags:
- `atom-text-area`: textarea emulation. This would be an editor that
  - does not show invisibles
  - does not show the gutter
  - does not have the 3 line padding 
  - does not grow by default
  - allows the themes to style the editor as a text area
- `atom-text-input`: a replacement for the mini editors

Then we could add attributes to enable things
- `show-gutters` would show the gutter
- `auto-height` would ignore css sizing
- `read-only` would set to read only instead of the remove `tabindex` hack 

The markdown preview can just use the `atom-text-editor` to get full code support.

"1408","ATOM_HOME does not affect default Chromium storage path","hi

i'm on Win7 64bit and downloaded the newest
atom-windows.zip version 0.178.0 from
https://github.com/atom/atom/releases
to test the new ATOM_HOME env var feature.

i've set the env var ATOM_HOME to the path
D:\portable_programs\Atom\ATOM_HOME
and started atom.exe .
now in the folder
D:\portable_programs\Atom\ATOM_HOME
appeared only one dir ""compile-cache"" and
only one file ""config.cson"". it looks like
an incomplete part of the files and folders
that would normally be created on the first run
of atom.exe in the folder
C:\Users\ <user> \.atom
the content of ""config.cson"" looks different
than usual and contains the line
""exception-reporting""

the folder
C:\Users\ <user> \AppData\Roaming\Atom
was created in the same place, like without
a present ATOM_HOME env var. so for the folder
C:\Users\ <user> \AppData\Roaming\Atom
the redirection via ATOM_HOME does not
work in the actual Atom version 0.178.0 .

for the folder
C:\Users\ <user> \.atom
the redirection via ATOM_HOME env var
works partially and the files
.gitignore , init.coffee , keymap.cson ,
snippets.cson and styles.less and the
folder packages were not created, when
ATOM_HOME was set.

also i would expect that the files and folders of
C:\Users\ <user> \.atom
would be placed in the ATOM_HOME env var mode
in the same subfolder .atom like
<path in ATOM_HOME> \.atom
but they landed directly in
<path in ATOM_HOME> \

"1409","Icons missing for theme using atom:// protocol","Some of the icons that I'm using seem to be missing when using the ATOM_HOME variable in my shell.

The theme doesn't seem to be the issue, it seems to be the way Atom is routing requests coming from the atom:// protocol.

I get the following errors in the console:

```

Looking through the code, I found [this line](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/44112f2ecd54eebe7496d1b581cac182e46ab0df/src/browser/atom-protocol-handler.coffee#L21) that may be pointing to the wrong directory, or rather, not respecting the ATOM_HOME variable.

apm gives the same error on the command line, unless sudo is used. In which case it works fine. On a possibly related note, packages linked via `apm link --dev` show up in the installed packages view like they should, but are not activateable.

"1411","Inserting control characters","To insert a control character:
- In GNU Emacs, I can precede the combination with `C-q` (`quoted-insert`).
- In Vim, I can precede the combination with `C-v`.
- In GNU nano, I can precede the combination with `M-v`.

But AFAIK there is no way to insert (and display, see #1839) control characters in Atom. The [GCS](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#index-formfeed) uses formfeed characters (control-L) to divide programs into pages at logical places, but I have to use other editors to do the insertion.

"1413","Node package exhibits odd, Windows-specific file system permissions issues when running inside Atom package","My package has a dependency that does some file system interaction, in this case, streaming a base64 encoded zip file to the file system. I'm the author of the package dependency as well. The code below (from the Atom package dependency) passes in tests on Linux, Unix, and Windows and works fine when used by my Atom package in Linux and Unix. However, when running in Atom on Windows, this code produces an Administrator-owned, read-only zip file that I can't seem to delete, even via the UI. What's odd to me is `fs.removeSync` does not throw an exception. I'm posting here because I've spent a lot of time determining whether this is Atom-specific behavior and I've come to the conclusion that it seems to be. Any idea why this may be occurring?

```
var zipStream = new Stream();
zipStream.readable = true;
zipStream.emit('data', new Buffer(result.zipFile, 'base64'));
zipStream.emit('end');

zipStream.pipe(fstream.Writer('/path/to/zipfile.zip'))

"1415","Tooltip ""discovery"" mode","@ricardograca suggested https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/117 to lower the delay for the tooltips of the tabs (already changed). But also:

> Even worse, is that if I jump from tab to tab, it takes another 2+ seconds for the next tooltip to appear. Usually I would expect the next tooltip to show up immediately if I move the cursor through the various tabs.

Might be worth to change it for all tooltips, not just for the tabs. Once a tooltip appears and there is no click, all other tooltips would appear almost instantly (`100s`) until you clicked somewhere. Useful for when you try to get more information of all the available options. Like hovering over all the buttons in Find + Replace.

"1416","Auto indent on paste behaves oddly with already indented lines.","When copying a segment of code that starts with a new-line followed by tabbed-in code while ""Auto Indent On Paste"" is enabled, consecutive pastes will each be an additional tab deeper. I tested this with C++, Java, and JavaScript which makes me believe it is not a problem with the language specs.

Here is an example in the form of an animated gif:
![autoindent-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/466761/6118758/d4ce2e04-b075-11e4-864b-46726fcd809e.gif)

It isn't just comments that this happens with, but it does require the previous line to be selected. Specifically, this happens when the copy-buffer matches a regex like `/^\n\s+[^\s]/`. That is, it starts with a newline, followed by one or more whitespace characters and then a non-whitespace character. And the previous line must be a blank line.

"1419","Atom not finding package updates","I am experiencing an issue very similar to the one described in #5213. However, I'm using a version of Atom/APM which was supposedly fixed (Atom v0.177.0, APM v1.3.4), and I'm not running a version of atom with a commit hash in the version number (as was the case in #5213).

Specifically, I'm trying to update my installation of the [web-browser](https://atom.io/packages/web-browser) plugin from 1.1.3 to 1.1.6. Unfortunately, neither APM nor atom seem to recognise that the plugin has an update available.

On second thought, I guess customization would become a lot harder if the `.atomrc` route was taken. Maybe just keeping those 5 config files separate would be a good solution? Not sure of the feasibility or repercussions.

I noticed that when typing with IME, Atom fires `onDidChange` on each keypress, but it's a performance waste. Because of IME only transform characters into REAL words when `enter` or `whitespace` is hit. Before that, editor should do nothing. 

I suggest:
- If `compositionstart` fired, stop sending `onDidChange`
- If `compositionend` fired, send `onDidChange` with new values
- Add events for CompositionEvents, e.g. `onCompositionStart`

"1431","About transposing two characters at the end of a line","In Emacs, one can use `C-t` (`transpose-chars`) to transpose two adjacent characters. Normally, `C-t` transposes the two characters on either side of point (the place in the buffer at which insertion and deletion occur). When given at the end of a line, rather than transposing the last character of the line with the newline, which would be useless, `C-t` transposes the last two characters on the line. So, if you catch your transposition error right away, you can fix it with just a `C-t`. If you don't catch it so fast, you must move the cursor back between the two transposed characters before you type `C-t`.

In Atom, `ctrl-t`   (`editor:transpose`) always transpose two adjacent characters, wherever they are. Will Atom change this behavior?

- Something like Mozilla's ""Good First Bugs"" and ""Mentored Bugs""
- Contribute to Atom Wiki, perhaps. (See https://discuss.atom.io/t/a-multilingual-wiki-for-atom/14640)

@syntax-font-family: 'Source Code Pro';

/* In Atom */
font-family: [Font Family from settings], @syntax-font-family, [Atom default];

Settings has priority, next the theme and lastly the Atom defaults. This should also fix the issue that while typing the font name in the settings, if you're not fast enough, it shows Times New Roman because the half typed name doesn't exist.

Or just make sure the `font-family` from the settings has higher specificity (if set). Like adding `!important`. :smiling_imp:

Not always, but quiet often, I have partial selection left behind when I select a portion of code on one line and then start typing hoping to replace the selected chars. When I type my first char, this causes selection jump to the characters on the right and they get deleted when I type the second char. For example, I have this `test.js` file:

``` js
  var where = _.pick({
    classified_id: query.classId,
    section_id: query.secId,
    category_id: query.catId
  }, function(val, key) {
    console.log('  **** val:', val);
    console.log('  **** key:', key);
    return !_.isUndefined(val);
  });
```

To replicate:
1. Select a portion of code on any line with a mouse or a touchpad. Release the mouse button.
1.  Switch to keyboard and press the space bar
1. You should see that the selected chars were deleted, but some of the chars on the right are selected now too. 
1. Press space bar again, and those extra selected chars get deleted
1. Do steps 1 and 2 a few times if you can't replicate it on first time.

This is a real pain since I always have to do `Command + Z` to undo  these side effects. Sometimes, I don't notice it and my code no longer runs.

"1485","Pasting or typing instead of selected text results in random selection","When I select some text and then paste something instead of it, sometimes I get random piece of the pasted text being selected. Look at the screencast:

Here I'm selecting pieces of text and pasting some other text. In one of three times it results in a part of the pasted text being selected.

It leads to some inconvenience in my work. After I replace selected text with text from the clipboard, I should check whether something is selected before I type anything (because the text I'm typing will replace the selection).

The same when I start typing while some text is selected. The typed symbol replaces the selection, but sometimes it becomes selected itself. So when I type the second symbol, it replaces the first one.

The behaviour which I observe in other text editors is: replace selected text with pasted/typed one, deselect anything, place the cursor after the pasted text. This is the most convenient option, I guess.

I tried to install vim-mode, but the installation failed with the error code ENOGIT. In the installation log there was an error message much like that in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4030 

If the user actually reads the failure log, it'll become quite obvious that they need to install git / put it in their %PATH for the installation to succeed. However, I think it would be better (if possible) to notify the user about the need to install git with a dialog, for example. Another option would be to have a text ""git is required to install this package"" next to the package in the GUI.

Edit: of course the very simplest way would be to say somewhere on the download page, or in the installer, that installing git is required.

You can find the correct location on the tree view, but on title the location don't change.

If this location is represent for the current folder on the view, it will confuse the user. It will be a disaster for a user editing 2 files with the same name in different folders.

> I wonder if we should offer a non-normalized variant of paste, like alt-cmd-v.

Opening this issue to ask for the above.

Rationale: I leave auto indentation on, and it (mostly) does the right thing, but sometimes I am moving code around that has indentation rules more complicated than Atom can understand. I'd love to have a quick way to paste the ""raw"" text without having Atom try to indent it. Kind of like ""paste without formatting"" in a spreadsheet.

An example of complicated indentation might be a docstring, or PEP8-style indenting to opening parens in Python. Ideally Atom would understand all these rules and do the right thing, but right now I often find myself re-indenting things after Atom strips them during paste.

"1519","API for Creating Custom Gutters","## Motivation

The Decorations API allows you to attach a class to gutters (and other things) and thus style them. However, we are working on a feature that requires us to be able to add our own HTML elements to the gutter, and would like to propose an API to do that.

**Feature:**
We would like to add buttons to the gutter next to lines that contain a test definition. Clicking on the button would run that test. (This is similar to functionality in Xcode.)

**Why CSS doesn't work:**
Adding CSS only allows us to create “buttons? via :before or :after pseudo-elements. These elements can't respond to events targeted to them; instead, any events they receive will register on the existing “line-number? gutter element. The gutter element already has another action to take in response to a click: it may expand or collapse a section of code. If we tried to add events to the gutter element itself (instead of a new child div), our events would conflict with the existing events from Atom.

**How the Line Numbers in the Gutter Work, Currently:**
When the editor is scrolled, line-number divs that have scrolled offscreen are removed, and new line-number divs for newly onscreen lines are added. The changes are primarily in the GutterComponent class, in “appendOrUpdateVisibleLineNumberNodes? (which calls into “buildLineNumberHTML?) and “removeLineNumberNodes?.

**Proposed Change:**
1. The most flexibility that an Atom API could offer is the ability to accept a function that will be run on each line-number div after it's added (and before it's removed, for any teardown work). In practice, this could lead to changes that affect things that might be considered “core? to Atom's look. It seems like this opens too much flexibility.
2. A more pared-down API that Atom could offer is the ability to add a column next to the gutter (either on the left side or right side, though it's understandable to limit this to the left side because the right side is occupied by “foldability?). The API for a Gutter object would accept a function that is given the line number, and returns a div for that line number, which would be inserted into the DOM next to the appropriate line number. (It would make sense for this insertion to be done in Atom Core code, because it already manages the positioning of the line numbers and does this via absolute positioning for performance optimisation.) 
## Desired Gutter Features

**Adding Gutters**
- Create gutter
  - You will most likely create one gutter instance per editor instance.
- API to add a gutter to an editor
  - Indicate whether to position it to the left or right of the line numbers
  - Pass a “z-index? of sorts to indicate how close/far from the edge it should be, similar to the “priority? argument to Atom.Workspace.add---Panel.

**Removing Gutters**
- Remove from view (toggle)
- Destroy

**Gutter Properties to Set**
- Set the width (?)

**Modifying Gutter Contents**
- Insert something inside a div next to each line
  - Initialize the Gutter object with a function that operates on a line number and returns a DOM element. As line-number divs are inserted and removed as the user scrolls, this function is run to determine what to place in the custom gutter next to each line number.
  - API could also allow:
    - Changing this function
    - Clear all the items in the gutter (a convenience)
  - For performance, by default, this function could run just once at initialization on the currently-displayed line numbers, and be run on progressively more line numbers as the user scrolls. The results could be cached.
    - The Gutter API should also expose a method that triggers the function to be run on the currently-displayed line numbers, or on a specific line. This could be useful if you want to update the gutter without the editor being scrolled.

"1529","Standalone TextEditor ","I tried to extract only text-editor component but it's difficult because of some native module and global properties(mainly atom.config). My purpose is to use instead of CodeMirror or use on other atom-shell project.

As far as I read, essential native module to work is only oniguruma for TextEditor,  and it wil be able to replace by pure RegExp (of cource I know it has speed problem}.

Atom can support this in the future? If anyone allow it I will refactor so but it looks difficult to touch many files under many pull requests...

"1536","Atom doesn't update file buffers correctly when switching branches.","Steps to reproduce.
1. `git checkout master`
2. `git checkout -b new_feature`
3. Open Atom with no files loaded.
4. Open an existing file and modify it. Keep it open.
5. `git commit -am ""Modifying file""`
6. `git checkout master`

At this point you'd expect to see that the edits which you made would be gone since you are now viewing a different branch. However, the edits show up and git diff even highlights them.

Also PR #1271 supposedly fixed #693 (Closing file buffers when a file gets removed via git i.e. switching branches, deleting, etc.) but that is not happening for me. When I switch branches and a file gets removed, it stays open in Atom with no indication that it's not supposed to be there.

Edit: Personally I think a file getting removed via git should automatically close the buffer, while a file getting removed in another way should prompt you. ""This file no longer exists, do you want to keep it open?"". This is how Notepad++ handles the situation and I think that is the best way.

There's no easy way that I know of to append to that list of defaults. Instead I have to track down what the defaults are, paste them in, and append my own grammar. Then I have to hope that the defaults don't change in a future version of Atom, making my copied list of defaults stale.

"1549","Better documentation for Disposables","One of the most common issues I've noticed with Atom packages is they fail to dispose their Disposables. This causes a whole load of problems with callbacks being registered multiple times when updating packages (or disabling and re-enabling them). Updating packages to fix issues often doesn't work because the old, broken callbacks stick around until you restart Atom.

The package development documentation hasn't really been updated since Disposables were introduced. [Your First Package](https://atom.io/docs/v0.169.0/your-first-package) and the [ascii-art package](https://github.com/atom/ascii-art/blob/master/lib/ascii-art.coffee) show how to register commands, but don't hold on to the Disposable, and don't call `dispose` in the `deactivate` method:

``` coffee
atom.workspaceView.command ""ascii-art:convert"", => @convert()
```

A few examples of popular packages not behaving properly:
### emmet

https://github.com/emmetio/emmet-atom/blob/60ad28616defddc8fb8746476717cc726b53b15b/lib/emmet.coffee#L117

### color-picker

https://github.com/thomaslindstrom/color-picker/blob/e9b64487f827223ca9ec0479f7075db48b43f02d/lib/ColorPicker.coffee#L18

So package developers often have no idea they're missing something. I think this is unfortunately contributing to a negative image - while Atom's core packages are great, users are bound to associate the problems caused by third party packages with Atom itself.

It needs to be made more explicit that when you register commands or other callbacks, you need to hold on to the Disposable, and you need to dispose it properly when you're done with it.

"1557","Common uncaught errors","I went through the uncaught errors looking for patterns. I know there are some we see over and over. It would be nice to dig into these.

These are ordered by apparent frequency.
### Permission / file doesnt exist / file in use issues

These just need better error messages. e.g.
- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4797
- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4850

Should be an easy fix, difficulty is catching all the cases.
#### Error from pathwatcher

Seems like a path is being watched, then something happens to that file, and pathwatcher freaks out

https://github.com/atom/atom/labels/error-from-pathwatcher
#### No trace; At fs.js:75
- EBUSY open: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4735
- EBUSY unlink: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4805
- ENOENT unlink: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4874
### Unable to watch path
- https://github.com/atom/node-pathwatcher/issues/39 (windows)
- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+unable+to+watch+path

Seems almost entirely linux based. Not sure how to fix.
### Spawn /atom/dir/atom ENOENT

Again, mostly linux. But a handful in OSX too. We need to figure out how to reproduce.

- osx: (these might be different?) https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4538, https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4754, https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4538

"1561","Wrong git modified color when using git subtree","Hi!

I have a git subtree under my directory `src/Rockbee/CoreBundle` and everything is up-to-date. Atom shows all other files as if they are modified (in yellow). Probably the file tree coloring is not dealing with subtrees correctly. Has anyone had the same problem? Maybe someone can give me some ideas on how to fix it on atom module. Thanks in advance.

"1562","File replacement does not work against directories","When saving a new file, if you decide to save it as the same name of a directory (no extension), it will ask if you would like to replace it. If you choose yes, it will error saying that that file is already a directory 

I am running Atom 0.165.0 for OSX.

There is no log in the debug console to provide.

There are basically three solutions to this:
1. Have it error after the ""replace"" button is clicked but before the dialog box is closed
2. Have it replace the directory
3. Have it handle directories and files separately (I'm not sure about other operating systems, but I'm pretty sure on OSX it considers them <name>.folder)

"1563","Atom not openning files on windows 7","Hi,
I am a regular atom on mac and I tried to install and use it on windows.

With a fresh windows instalation (w7) (well I did install my [starred packages](https://atom.io/users/hanoc/stars)) I'm getting this error every time I try to open a file or a folder:

Atom is not starting from windows power shell in safe mode using:

```
atom --safe
```

In fact I'm not being able to start atom from the console. My powershell recognises atom and apm as commands (and apm stars --install did work) but if I do atom foo.txt foo.txt does not get opened in atom.

If I run atom specs I get this:

This is with the Shadow DOM enabled.

If I unlink the bracket-matcher package and restart Atom, everything works as expected:

"1570","""Uncaught TypeError: Unable to watch path"" Windows / Linux samba share","I run into this issue repeatedly. I know there are already a bunch of reports about this error message, but it's hard to tell what are duplicates because of all the variations. When I get this now it's paired with a second error:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Unable to watch path
Uncaught ReferenceError: spawnSync is not defined
```

(See bottom for detailed version.)

The details about my situation:

Atom (currently 0.153.0), no packages installed, running on Windows 7 x64.

Atom will run fine for some amount of time, then I try to open a file and get this error. It doesn't seem to be related to renaming files, as in some of the other reports. At least sometimes I can still open a file in a different window. At least sometimes I can open a file in the same window with a different path. For example, I'm often loading files from a samba share running on Ubuntu 12, e.g.

`\\server\share\somedir\somefile`

When the problem strikes I don't seem to be able to load any more files from `\\server\share\somedir` in the same window. But if I map a drive to the same share, I seem to be able to load files from there, e.g.:

`Z:\somedir\somefile`

I've already tried setting `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` to `32768` (on the Ubuntu system) as suggested in #2082 and the problem persists.

"1574","Show zoom level (in status bar?)","I wasn't sure the best place to put this (maybe [status-bar?](https://github.com/atom/status-bar)), but it would be nice to be able to see the zoom level somewhere in the UI. Since it's possible to zoom using `Cmd + -` / `Cmd + =`, it's possible to not realize the editor is zoomed because there's no way of telling.

It might also be cool to have some kind of visual feedback when you do zoom - maybe some kind of modal alert that pops up saying ""Zoom: 125%"" (for example) and fades away.

"1575","Make Find UI position lockable","The Find UI is a bar across the bottom of the editor.  I also have a linter which places a bar across the bottom.  Depending on what line the cursor is on, the linter output will contain 0+ lines, so the linter bar height varies depending on the line.

When I search for a term, I click the 'Find' button.  The cursor moves to the next found instance, and the linter height changes, moving the 'Find' button away from my mouse cursor.  In effect, I have to look down at the mouse cursor and point it at the 'Find' button every time I want to find the next instance of the search term.  

It is common to browse code looking for instances of a search term, and this seems like a simple fix to make usable.  An option to affix the Find bar at the very bottom would do the trick.
","enhancement"
"1576","Want API for changing the cursor blink rate","I don't see any documentation for this, so maybe it's my fault, but I would like an API for changing the cursor blink speed. It's faster than most other apps on OS X, and the inconsistency squicks my CDO. I definitely don't need or want it changed in the base app, but would like the ability to make a package for it. I am aware of [ease-blink](https://atom.io/packages/ease-blink) but I don't see the API it uses in the documentation, and the search isn't finding it. I will freely admit that I am brand new to Atom and thus am probably missing something; pointers to the manual would be greatly appreciated, if that's what I'm missing!

"1594","How to build without downloading modules?","I'm trying to package Atom for a distribution I use called [Exherbo Linux](http://exherbo.org/), which is a source-based distribution akin to Gentoo, and it's package manager uses a sandbox when building packages so that they do not mess with the system outside when not expected. This includes sandboxing the network, so that it can not contact the outside world and is only allowed to use any whitelisted IP addresses, or instead has to fetch dependencies outside of the compilation process.

Atom presents a problem here, because it's build script fetches dependencies while installing, which is not allowed in the sandbox.

To get the point, my question is: is there a supported way to fetch dependencies of the build script, disable any network related operations during compilation, and then build as normal?

"1595","Issue with String.localeCompare in Atom Helper","I am writing a plugin that uses `vinyl-fs`, one of it's node modules uses `String.localeCompare`.  In the new version of atom I am having an issues with this function that does not exist in my local version of node 0.11.14

``` bash
~/g/atom-typescript-tools: /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Frameworks/Atom\ Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom\ Helper
> process.version
'v0.11.14'
> 'asdf'.localeCompare('sd')

~/g/atom-typescript-tools: node
> process.version
'v0.11.14'
> 'asdf'.localeCompare('sd')
-18
```

As you can see if I open Atom Helper as a node process, run the localeCompare test and it throws a segmentation fault.  In my local node 0.11.14 install it works fine.   I suspect that there is an issue where the localeCompare code utilizes some system library that isn't compiled correctly for my os version.  I am running OSX 10.10 and have not updated to 10.10.1 and the new command line tools yet.

"1600","Renderer process hogs CPU after opening and closing settings tab","1. Open a new instance of Atom.
2. Check the CPU usage of all Atom processes. They should be close to 0%, with occasional spikes.
3. Open the settings tab (Ctrl+,), then immediately close it. Repeat this step 20 times.
4. Check the CPU usage of all Atom processes. The renderer process (`atom.exe --type=renderer ...`) will now be constantly consuming CPU time (~12% on my quad-core PC).

If you repeat step 3 enough times, eventually the renderer process will consume 100% CPU time on a single core, and Atom becomes very unresponsive.

This is on Windows 7 after a fresh install of Atom. The only settings I have changed are to set the theme to Atom Light/Base16 Tomorrow Dark.

I took some profile measurements using the Developer Tools. After performing the above steps, Atom is spending 86× more CPU time in `React.createClass.toggleCursorBlink` and 61× more CPU time in `React.createClass.pollDOM`. I guess that Atom is failing to clean up some `setInterval`s, or similar.

I wanted to attach profile measurements, but the ‘save’ button in the profiler just saves an empty file.

The pasteboard gets updated when a search field changes or the user hits ⌘-E with text selected.  It can be pretty handy when you're searching through code for the same keyword, and most apps seem to generally respect it (Safari/XCode/Chrome/etc).  In general it seems like apps check it when they become active and update their search fields.

Chromium definitely supports NSFindPboard ([with some of the impl here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/git-svn/ui/base/cocoa/find_pasteboard.mm)), but I'm not sure that stuff is accessible at all from the Javascript layer.  

One option is just to shell out to pbpaste/pbcopy to get/update the pboard's contents, as in:

```
 pbpaste -pboard find
```

will dump the contents of NSFindPboard to stdout.

You could also technically get at it with NodeObjC, but that seems like overkill.

3) press ctrl + c
4) go to the end of line
5) hit backspace 1 time to delete the last O

"1622","Hide system window title bar","Hi! Could it be possible to implement system window title bar/borders hiding like Chromium/Chrome has?

If you have used Chromium/Chrome you can notice it lacks the ""system window title bar"" by default (ie, the bar that says the name of the window and has the minimize, maximize and close buttons), while at the same time providing its own tiny minimize, maximize and close buttons in the top, rightmost part of the window.

Some window managers for Linux let you hide the window title bar, but since Atom lacks its own minimize/maximize/close buttons, it becomes inconvenient. Besides, it would be something nice to have in Windows/OSX too.

IMHO, this feature manages to save (precious!) vertical space, and looks much more pleasant.

Pushing up/down arrow key,  I expected the cursor to move to the nearest location vertically.
tab indent also seems to be laid out in wrong way.

You get spooky pulsing comments with the Shadow DOM turned off and default-colored comments with the Shadow DOM turned on ... but you get un-italic comments in both cases.

2. Create new lines.
3. Select them.
4. Use command Editor: Split Selections Into lines.
5. Write something.

I have tried this on Windows 7 Pro and Ubuntu 14.04 both running Atom 0.152. I might try this on Windows 8 if this helps

Issue seems similiar to https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3187.

Notes:
- I can’t get to a usable atom editor by clicking any of the three buttons in the alert pane.
  - clicking ""reload"" just makes the alert pane show up again (this time connected to the atom window).
  - clicking ""keep it open"" just dismisses the alert pane, leaving me with an empty atom window.
  - clicking ""close window"" hangs for approx ~1s and then closes the window, leaving atom running, but with no open windows.
- The behaviour is the same whether I start atom from the terminal, or via Finder.
- `atom --safe` and `atom --dev` both produces the same behaviour.
- `atom --version` shows `0.157.0`.

"1634","UTF-8 problems: characters mysteriously incorrectly encoded","Atom 0.155 / Mac OS X 10.10.1

I’ve encountered a problem that I am reasonably certain was caused by Atom, but which I cannot reproduce (and therefore I have no test case to submit). I know how unuseful such a bug report is, but thought you should be aware of the issue.

99% of the time I am programming, and so am pretty much just using ASCII. However, everything is saved in UTF-8, as is usual nowadays and is Atom’s default. During the last couple of days I needed to update a bunch of strings/locales files (de, es, fr, it, ja, pt-BR, zh-Hans, and zh-Hant) and now see several garbled characters have been introduced into lines which previously were good and which I had not edited. (I can tell this from the SVN history, for example in a de file I edited, I can see the line I changed, but also in a line I did not edit I see a ö converted to �.) (The files in question had only been edited by me, only using Atom.)

If I do a Find in Project for � (not scientific, I’m sure, but I’m not sure what else I can do) and restrict it just to the locales directory, I see a lot of results from files that previously were good. I can’t find any way to copy-and-paste from the Find in Project results pane, so here is a screenshot:

![screen shot 2014-12-10 at 17 05 09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7255543/5393735/1d7b4a94-8135-11e4-8576-5c4b5502326f.png)

Confusingly, some of those files are in fact fine. If I open them by clicking on the line in the Find in Project results pane I do not see the garbled character and the result then disappears from the results pane.

This only happens with seemingly random characters, not all. For example in one pt-BR file a ç became garbled but other instances of the same character did not. Similarly in a de file one ö became garbled but others did not.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help pinpoint the issue. Unfortunately I can’t attach the actual locale files as they are private.

  - when they are attached to the same marker attempt to dock overlays together such that they appear in concert
- when a cursor or other editor driven marker would be obscured by an overlay we could push it in a different direction.
- when a mouse intersects an overlay it would be nice to have some standard interaction options.  
  -  hide on mouse intersects
  -  fade out on mouse intersects,  ideally this level would allow you to place a cursor behind it and highlight text ranges.
  -  fully interactable with mouse
- in order to better prioritize multiple overlays for positioning and or removal there should probably be a priority setting
  - low: used for informational overlays that can be obscured or removed by higher priority items
  - medium: used for errors and warning overlays that should be prioritized over other informational overlays
  - high: used for interactive popups that can have mouse, and keyboard interactions associated with them, these are positioned very aggressively removing any informational popups if they don't fit in.

Ideally we would have some patterns to follow regarding how to create overlays.

"1666","Undo grouping is too eager","Undo grouping seems to group any editor changes no matter what kind of change it was, which results in confusing/unexpected behaviour.
1. Create a new file
2. Paste some text into it
3. Immediately begin typing
4. Undo

Atom will group both the pasting and the typing, so the undo removes everything. Ideally it should only remove the typing, with the paste being a separate undo. ST2 has this behaviour and its much nicer. I'll often start typing after pasting some code, and want to undo something I just typed. It's infuriating when the whole lot disappears!

The same problem happens for many editor commands such as `editor:auto-indent`. Perform an auto indent, then begin typing (or run another command). Undo will revert both.

My suggestion is that Atom should only group sequences of identical commands. Disparate commands should never be grouped.

Are there cases where grouping disparate commands makes more sense than keeping them separate?

"1668","Autocomplete Next","We're not quite ready to tackle a new autocomplete yet, but I wanted to start the conversation as there are several folks interested in working on autocomplete: @mark-hahn, @lee-dohm, @joefitzgerald, @abe33.

Once we finish with API related things, I was planning on:
- Looking at `autocomplete-plus` code
- Checking out all of the existing providers out there.
  - How many are out there? What are the popular ones?
- Looking at code @mark-hahn and @lee-dohm produced recently
- Looking at other editors. How do they do it? Do they have APIs?
- Are there autocomplete daemons out there we can use (e.g. https://github.com/nsf/gocode for Go)

Then I would come up with a plan of attack for the new version. In my mind, we have a couple options:
- Extend `autocomplete` with an API
- Take over `autocomplete-plus` with some modifications and API changes
- Write something completely new

I am not sure what the best way forward is right now. I do feel, though, that the hard part is not the UI that pops up the completion box, it's having great language support, and a nice API for adding completions.

It would be great if you guys could help me / us work through the research phase. Off the top of my head, I'm thinking these would be a big help:
- Your opinions and suggestions for the provider API.
- Your architectural suggestions (I know @mark-hahn wrote one recently)
- Comments explaining the pitfalls and your frustrations of the current `autocomplete-plus` API. Maybe suggestions on improvements.
- Links to autocomplete providers for languages (either generic providers or for other editors)
- Explanations / links to APIs in other editors
- General autocomplete API related frustrations and desires

"1675","Soft tabs setting is not syntax-scoped","This may be causing confusion with folks that use hard tabs much of the time.
## Repro Steps
1. Start Atom
2. Set `editor.softTabs` to `false`
3. Set `.source.gfm` `editor.softTabs` to `true` (Must be done in the `config.cson` because the UI doesn't offer this setting)
4. Set `.source.gfm` `editor.tabLength` to `4`
5. Open a new file
6. Open Developer Tools
7. Execute:
   
   ``` javascript
   editor = atom.workspace.getActiveEditor()
   editor.getSoftTabs()                       # => false

"1676","Font size too small in the settings GUI.","As other people have reported, Atom comes with a small font size can only be fixed by editing config files (see #3792). I had the same problem with the Settings GUI. Unfortunately, this is very difficult to fix by editing `styles.less`. In particular, you cannot simply change `@font-size` in your local `styles.less` file. To make Atom usable for me, I had to locate my Atom installation, locate my theme, locate `ui-variables.less` and edit `@font-size` there directly. I still have not managed to get the check buttons to have a reasonable font size.

Clearly, fixing the font size is far more difficult than it should be. I ask that you add the UI font size and font family to the settings menu so that people can change them easily.

"1691","Single file handling still unfriendly","While #3355 was a significant improvement in editing individual files without opening the entire containing directory, this is only true when a project directory is already open.

On the other hand, I often create short, temporary bash scripts or quick Haskell experiments in small files in $HOME.  If I try to use Atom to edit these, then inevitably it slows to a crawl trying to deal with the many thousands of files in that directory.  If I accidentally try to pull up project symbols, or similar it will hang long enough to justify killing manually.

It would be lovely if there were a way to differentiate between opening a directory/project and opening a file.  I realize that some people consider this a feature rather than an issue, or will tell me not to put such files in $HOME, but it would be unfortunate to exclude some use cases without reason to do so.

"1699","Indentation wiped out on paste","Hi, I just checked out and built v0.150.0 and I'm seeing an issue where indentation is being broken on pasted lines regardless of the setting of Auto Indent,  Auto Indent On Paste, and Normalize Indent On Paste.  With all these settings off  it doesn't preserve the existing indentation of the copied rows, it strips all indentation from the first row then removes that same amount of whitespace from the indent on subsequent rows.

Additionally if I turn on Auto Indent On Paste it moves all rows in the pasted text to the same indent level, being that of the most indented line in the paste, instead of preserving the original heirarchy.

eg, when editing HAML:

```
|    %table
|      %tr
|        %td
|        %td
|  %table.reqs
```

if I copy and paste the tr and tds with all indent options off I get:

```
|    %table
|      %tr
|        %td
|        %td
|%tr
|  %td
|  %td
|  %table.reqs
```

And with auto indent on paste enabled I get:

```
|    %table
|      %tr
|        %td
|        %td
|        %tr
|        %td
|        %td
|        %table.reqs

Note that last line in the last example - that's actually pre-existing text after the paste that also gets pushed out to the new indent level :scream:

However, if I released shift and pressed it again, then once again, the keybinding would fail to resolve. When I tested a third keybinding, `O p`, I found that it always succeeded, unless I pressed shift at some point before typing `p`.

This seems to indicate that the `<shift-down>` event is breaking multikey bindings.

The main goal here is to improve exception user experience (e.g. #3715). This can be extended to general user messaging. Say when the config file has an error, or info messages like when a theme has reloaded in dev-live-reload. 

In addition to showing the error message, the exception flow should either have
- A way to submit a bug report with the stack trace and related atom info
- A way to copy the entire stack trace

"1719","Reload causes cursor/selection misalignment (for @font-face fonts)","Possibly related to #3201, if you have fonts loaded through `@font-face` (e.g. using my fonts package), a reload causes the cursor/selection alignment to misbehave. Switching to the default font (i.e. empty the font family box in settings) restores it. You can then switch back to an `@font-face` font and it will work properly again.

Steps to reproduce:
- Use an `@font-face` font as outlined here: https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-do-i-load-google-fonts-into-my-editors-styles/8321/7 (or by using http://atom.io/packages/fonts).
- Put the name of the font in settings (e.g. 'aka-coder').
- Open a file in Atom: all should look well in the new font.
- Choose View > Reload.
- Cursor and selection should now misalign. You can check this by double-click-selecting a word or by typing a row of characters.
- Switch to settings.
- Empty the font-family setting.
- Switch to the file and all should look well again in the default font.

"1720","Bug when starting editor under certain conditions","When I closed the editor I had a file open in a tab. It was named ""summarize"". 
With the editor closed I ended up having to do some restructuring of the project folder and this file was moved into a directory called ""summarize"" under a different name.
Later in the day I tried to start up Atom again, it failed to the debug screen. It was throwing an error saying that this file was now a directory. I ended up having to rename the directory temporarily to be able to open the editor, then close the tab in the editor, rename the directory again to it's original name and all was well.
Suggestion: the editor should fail more gracefully in this circumstance. When a directory replaces a file of the same name, the editor should just close the tab or gray it out with an explanation or alert.

"1723","documentation improvement suggestion - how to see your changes to the source code without building","I'm the one who asked a question in this link: https://discuss.atom.io/t/do-you-use-atom-while-hacking-on-the-core-editor/13207

All the answers were very valuable, but I think @postcasio's answer would be especially very helpful for newbies like me who just started contributing to Atom. I copied the answer to here for your convenience:

""-r sets the resources path, which is normally Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app. Your working copy is your local copy of the atom repository. So if you cloned to /Users/yjw9012/github/atom you would run:
atom -r /Users/yjw9012/github/atom
Then instead of loading the code bundled in Atom.app, it will load the code you're working on.
Also, looking at the source, dev mode will load from ~/github/atom it exists. So if you have your copy stored there, you can just run atom -d.""

I was curious if there was a much faster way to see your code changes to the source code than rebuilding it by executing 'script/build'. It's true that building Atom takes a very few minutes (probably, less than 2 minutes), but I believe that some people might consider it's even too long.

My suggestion would be that we need to modify the answer above a little bit and put that in the build instruction for OS X(https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/build-instructions/os-x.md) or other contribution guide pages at least.

"1725","Constant crash, reload when renaming files","Recently experiencing a ton of crashes which require me to reload the entire editor window when renaming files.

I cannot say for sure, but I have a feeling its related to new files. That is, files created after the initial editor window is loaded (again, not 100% on that).
#### Steps:
1. Create a new file in the project directory currently open in Atom (either using Atom or `echo ""Test"" >> new.txt`).
2. Rename the file (either using Atom of `mv new.txt old.txt`)
3. Crash window opens and forced to reload the editor.

_Note:_ Quitting then relaunching does not seem to help.

Since Atom is based on Chromium, it would be beneficial to implement the Chromium task manager so that a user can see resource usage by package. Here is what Chromium's task manager looks like:

The main issue here is that Atom will try to open files in UTF8 (or the default encoding, if set), which will potentially break any non-UTF8 files. And that, imho, is not an acceptable/valid behavior for any editor.

This should be tagged as 1.0 blocker.

"1742","Dead keys and diacritics are not working","Hi,

I've been using atom in Ubuntu 14.04 for a while and I've never been able to make my diacritics and dead keys work. I'm using a Spanish keyboard (es_ES) and the diacritics which are entered by pressing a dead key + a vowel (áéíóúü ?É?ÓÚÜ) don't work. There's no problem with other Spain's symbols (ñ Ñ € ¿ ? ¡ !) so I guess this issue is related to dead keys.

I just built atom 0.145.0-3462d99, but as I said I've had this problem for a couple of months.

"1746","Inconsistent environment and behaviour","# Problem

Various tools don't operate correctly depending on the order and the manner with which Atom is started.

Also, persisted state is not restored consistently.
# Cause

Depending the manner in which Atom is started, a different environment is inherited.
- **launchd event**: inherits launchd mostly blank env, which means no shell env vars
- **`atom` in the terminal**: inherits currently set vars

This applied to when the app is _started_, not when a new window is opened, in which case that window will inherit the current process env (which is normal OS X behaviour)

I venture the creation of the `atom` command this way is on purpose to work around the lack of env when run from launchd. But please, dear reader, continue on to the next step.
# Current workaround / Anti-feature

Manually control Atom startup each time you want to use it in a specific environment.

Why is it an anti feature? If you want two projects open at the same time but with different environments, you're busted.

Also, long running sessions and _""wait what env was that started with already?""_ (session can also mean the idiomatic ""document != app"" OS X way: ""Atom.app is started but no windows are opened"") .

Also also, frustration quickly sets in when you start it up the wrong way and have to quit and restart halfway through your work and notice your linter does not actually run (manual config does not cut it because 1. it's manual and 2. constantly changing versions means constantly changing path).
# Possible solution
1. wrap Atom.app startup in a login shell (i.e make `Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom` a script that calls whatever the user shell is† as a login, non-interactive one before calling the real `Atom` binary), to inherit global env, so that chruby/rbenv/GOPATH/whatever works.
2. make `atom` command send a signal to `Atom.app` instead of starting atom itself via `Contents/MacOS/Atom`. Basically, `atom foo/bar` has no reason to be different from `open -a Atom foo/bar`. ~~Precisely, it _does not_ inherit the local environment.~~
3. local environment management is bestowed to package implementor (meaning detection of `.git`, `Gemfile`, `.rubocop.yml`, `.gopath`, which they have to do anyway else at least starting via launchd is broken, if not more), not to manual handling by developer.
# Consequences
- `PATH` & al. is properly set and tools like linters can leverage the env to use chruby/rbenv/whatever.
- Clicking the icon, starting via spotlight, opening a file from Finder, using `open -a Atom` and using `atom foo` on the terminal are all consistent, whatever the order they are executed in.
- Everything is now consistent and we can now rejoice as glittery roses spontaneously bloom out of Bose-Einstein condensates.
# Additional note

Pet peeve: `atom` is currently equivalent to `atom .`. While I can see how this could be ok on other platforms, this is subtly wrong on OS X as `atom` is expected to be equivalent to `open -a Atom`, i.e start the app and don't open anything (unless it's set up to open a new document when no document is opened, otherwise merely focus the app, and if the app is not started, start it)

On another planet, I don't know if this issue applies to other OSes as well besides OS X. Everything depends on how process management and app/doc/task GUI model is handled there.
# Final word

All of this really matters daily when you juggle between projects and makes Atom feel like an unfinished, brittle product, making angry coworkers throwing nails at me for having pushed Atom on them.

† think fish-shell or (god forbid) csh.

"1747","""SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN"" in packages and themes tab of settings","Hello,

I've been using Atom now as my main code editor for months and I love it. However, I've noticed in the last couple of versions that there seems to be a problem with accessing the packages and Themes tab of the settings. Whenever I search for something, I get this error come up:
    SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN
I have tried uninstalling Atom and reinstalling it, and the same problem comes up.
Is this an Atom problem, or more likely something to do with my laptop, and if so, what?
I'm running a MacBook Air on Mac OSX 10.10 Yosemite with Atom version 0.144.0.
Any help would be most appreciated, since I don't seem to be able to add extensions any more.

Many thanks,

"1752","Multiple-window menu bug on Windows","On Windows only, when I open multiple Atom windows, then jump from one window's menu to the other window's menu, the menu actions affect the former window.  It should affect the latter window.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open two windows in Atom.
2. In Window 1, click the ""View"" menu.  Leave it open.
3. In Window 2, click the ""View"" menu.  The menu in Window 1 will close when you click it.
4. Click something like, say, ""View -> Developer -> Toggle Developer Tools"".  The tools are toggled on Window 1, even though you clicked the item in Window 2.

I noticed this problem while looking at https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/802.  In that case, I noticed that I could open two Atom windows, launch ""File -> Open File..."" in Window 2, then apparently open Window 2's menu by first clicking on Window 1's menu.  Selecting something in Window 2's apparent menu actually affects Window 1.

Atom 0.141.0, Mac OS 10.9.5. When using `alt-delete` to delete to end of word, I feel like the natural thing should be to erase all the whitespace in one stop, without removing any visible characters. As you can see above, if I wanted to eliminate a bunch of whitespace by hitting `alt-delete`, it eats up some of the code in the process.

On Linux sometimes artifacts are left momentarily on the screen after a resize completes or when closing the app. However this is probably less prevalent in the Mac version because Chromium interacts better with Cocoa than it does w GTK. 

This has a been a persistent problem in Chromium since they've gonre to Aura.

"1776","Atom takes over keyboard shortcuts in Help menu search box","Not sure if this is an issue with Atom or atom-shell. If you focus the search box in the Help menu, keyboard shortcuts are still handled by the editor.
1. Enter some text in the search box
2. Press cmd+a. The search box loses focus and the text is not selected.

Similarly,
1. Enter some text in Atom and select it
2. Enter some text in the search box and select it.
3. Press cmd+c. The editor text is copied instead of the text in the search box.

"1777","Include more details in the release notes","I think it would be a great idea if you included more details in the release notes when you release a new version, as you guys just published 0.141 around 10 hours ago, but the release notes for the release are incredibly basic, and I noticed you guys made a lot of commits for the 0.141 release before you guys actually released it, so you guys might want to make the release notes more detailed, as in detailing all the changes instead of just covering the ""Notable changes"", as it would prove really useful to the people who want to know all the changes.

"1779","Atom protocol for files in .atom directory","Currently the `atom` protocol only looks in the two `packages` directories and Atom's `node_modules` directory. I have a replacement background image in my `styles.less` that I store in `~/.atom/resources` but I have to use the full path to the file. It would be nice to be able to use the protocol for cases like this as well, e.g. `background-image: url(atom://resources/transparent-background.png)`

"1780","/* */ comment on a single line inside braces keeps trying to un-indent","If I have a `/* comment */` on a single line, Atom automatically un-indents the line immediately when I type the closing `*/` and after various edits elsewhere on the line.

![outdent-bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120506/4844110/e771aa82-6038-11e4-970f-4dd21e48f05f.gif)

(the re-indentation in that gif is me hitting `ctrl+]` to fix it)

It only seems to occur if the comment is inside some manner of braces or parentheses, for example:
- `/* foo */` (comment only thing on the line) perfectly fine
- `foo /* bar */` also fine
- `if( /* foo */` is fine but as soon as I type the closing `)` it outdents (and then again for subsequent additions to the line), or if the `)` was already there thanks to auto-insertion of closing brackets

I _think_ this may be specific to JavaScript syntax, so apologies if the issue should be on language-javascript instead.

Happens in atom built straight off master, but has been happening for a while now, definitely at least since 0.120 or so. Also happens with `--safe` so it isn't a package issue.

"1781","Problems with selection and cursor position in complex non-latin scripts","Atom has a problem in dealing with Devanagari, in that the cursor position does not always reflect the actual position if there is some Devanagari text in the current line. Same goes for selecting within lines containing Devanagari.

I can also see that Atom renders Devangari as fully formed Devangari with half-forms, conjuncts (ligatures), and so on. For an editor I would much prefer the Sublime Text approach, where Devanagari text is treated as a string of characters with no attempt to render half-forms, conjuncts, and do the other advanced OpenType compositing features. Instead the text is rendered the way it is typed, which is much much easier to edit.

Here is some sample text that borks Atom:

```
<span class=""Glyphs"">NO LANG ‘रृ’ “रॄ? ल- लृ–!!!???,.</span></span></br>
```

(Try here to select the ??? and delete them…)

```
<span class=""ModelNorthern"">रृ रॄ ल लृ लॄ ऌ ॡ </span></b>
```

(Try here to select the Devanagari characters and delete them…)

Also try to paste those strings into Sublime Text and see how ST renders the Devanagari as full-forms + halants/virama + matras in sequential order, which I would prefer.

Because the monospaced fonts we use often do not have Devanagari, the Devanagari is rendered in a proportional fall-back font. If you did as in Sublime Text you could force the advance-width of all the Devanagari glyphs to be the same as the default monospaced font. That way you could preserve monospaced text and get around the whole – very thorny – issue of mixing in complex non-latin scripts in a monospaced environment.

Just an idea, so up to you to find out if that would actually be a way to go.

I note that you have partially fixed the issue in 0.140, but it’s still not perfect. Take this example line:

```
<span style=""word-wrap: break-word"">क ख ग घ ङ च छ ज ? ञ ट ठ ड ढ ण त थ द ध न प फ ब भ म य र ऱ ल ळ व श ष स ह क़ ख़ ग़ ज़ ड़ ढ़ फ़ य़ ॹ ॻ ॼ ॾ ॿ</span><br><br>
```

If you try to select it with the mouse, from the end towards the beginning of the line, then the last br> is not selected.

If you select the Devanagari text and press delete, then you end up with this:

```
<span style=""word-wrap: break-word"">pan><br><br>
```

(notice the missing </s in the closing span tag).

"1803","can't get rid of untitled tabs","There are two problems with untitled tabs.  These untitled tabs are created with `atom.workspace.open()`.
- When there is an untitled tab with contents, and you close Atom and select `Don't Save`, when atom reopens the untitled tab reappears with no contents.  This happens even when there are multiple normal tabs.  If you do this over and over you get more and more untitled tabs.
-  When my code executes `editor.delete()` for an untitled tab the contents are deleted but the tab view doesn't go away.

These seem like the same bug to me.

After running `atom --dev` to work on a package that is in my `~/github` directory and then symlinked in `~/.atom/dev/packages`, then I try the following in the console: 

```
minimap = atom.packages.getActivePackage('minimap')
=> Package {path: ""/Users/cedric/.atom/packages/minimap"", metadata: Object, emitter: Emitter, name: ""minimap"", stylesheets: Array[1]…}

but it doesn't work.

I looked into the source code. The [only line](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v0.136.0/src/selection.coffee#L362), which does anything with `undo`, is:

```
newBufferRange = @editor.buffer.setTextInRange(oldBufferRange, text, pick(options, 'undo'))
```

In [`setTextInRange`](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/blob/v3.2.8/src/text-buffer.coffee#L512), the `undo` option becomes `normalizeLineEndings` (default: `true`). It looks like `normalizeLineEndings` has nothing to do with undo.

"1830","Snippets should be displayed in autocomplete","I'm using Atom V0.135.0 for web development. When working in a HTML file, I wrote `ta` and pressed `ctrl+space` hoping to autocomplete it to `table`. I was surprised to see no `table` in autocomplete suggestion. My initial thought was that Atom does not support HTML autocompletes and I was very disappointed. But I could not believe Atom missed such a basic functionality. So I digged deeper. I found that atom has HTML _snippets_ which can be used by writing `ta` and pressing `tab` key to use the `table` snippet.

This behavior is very counter intuitive. Behind the scenes, I do not care if it's implemented as _autocomplete_ or _snippet_, but when I write a half-word and press the _autocomplete_ key combination, I expect everything to be displayed there as a suggestion, even the snippets. What do the devs think about it?

I propose doing a couple things:
- adding a new `editor.tabType` setting that accepts 3 values: Auto, Hard, Soft. With the default being `auto`. Then in the scoped settings for each language, they can set it to whatever they want. 
- Changing `TextEditor::setSoftTabs` to being a settings override accepting 4 values: unset / use-the-settings, Auto, Hard, Soft
- Reading the settings on each time we need to get the tab type. Something like (pseudo code): 

``` coffee
getTabType: (scopeDescriptor) ->
  @userTabTypeOverride or atom.config.get(scopeDescriptor, 'editor.tabType') or atom.config.get(scopeDescriptor, 'editor.softTabs') or 'soft'

Thinking I'd managed to delete some config somewhere went and set stuff back to how it was, but nothing was persisted and everything was reset on next restart. I'm guessing this is Atom refusing to overwrite the existing file, though I couldn't see any errors to that effect in the dev tools.

The behaviour of not completely clobbering an invalid config is good but maybe there could be a warning in the UI and/or the invalid config.cson be copied somewhere else so that subsequent changes can be persisted properly.

"1843","Problem in handling hierarchical .gitignore in the treeview","Hi, and first, thank you so much for your project.

This problem first appeared in my work project which is unfortunately private. All my files was considered as ignore and appeared in grey in the treeview. I took some time and finally succeed to isolate and reproduce it.

In a Git project, if a .gitignore from a subdirectory match a path from the root of the project, the treeview will use the rule and ignore the path while it's incorrect. Indeed, Git will not do the same mistake and the `git status` will be different as what Atom show.

You can easily test on this repository I create to demonstrate the problem:
https://github.com/Swiip/atom-git-tree-test
The `test.txt` file inside the src directory should not be displayed grey as it's not ignored in git.

If it's needed, I tested on a Mac with OSX 10.9.5, Atom 0.134.0, I tried several times to delete cached files and it change nothing. I have no error in the developer panel.

"1864","Atom not focused correctly on launch","I'm using Atom 0.130 on Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity.  When running Atom the application will come to the foreground but it isn't correctly focused - the title and left launcher show the previously focused application.  Steps to replicate:
- Open an application that isn't atom
- Run atom from the dash
- See the title bar/launcher still thinking the previous application is focused.

The image below shows the issue - I had Firefox focused before opening Atom.

Pressing tab at the cursor position results in nothing happening. Indenting with `cmd+]` works normally.

It seems that you can only indent a maximum of `floor(spaces / tabLength)` times.

e.g. if I use 6 spaces with a tab length of 4, I can indent once, then it stops working:

Another suggestion is to be able to manually export a .atomconfig JSON file that I could just import to Atom at any point to configure settings, install packages, change themes, etc.

I think having the first would be more important for most people, but for anyone who is offline and for anyone who likes to keep their own backups in other places, the manual settings export is really useful.

But there's never a stack trace, so this error message isn't very actionable. It's my understanding that stacktraces are only captured when the devtools are open before the error is thrown.

One solution to this is to always have the devtools open, but that takes up screen space. Another is to pop them out of the Atom window, but that gets confusing if you have multiple windows open.

It would be nice to have some kind of ""invisible"" devtools mode where it will still capture stacktraces (and do whatever else it does), but otherwise have the editor work normally. There's probably some kind of performance penalty incurred by having the devtools open, so maybe this could be behind a flag like `atom --debug`.

"1892","Click Under Text Moves Cursor Incorrectly","Just a minor issue; when you click to move the cursor **underneath** the section with actual text in it, the cursor clamps to the last line but stays in the correct column.

"1894","Add option to disable ""open devtools on error""","Hi, I understand the need to open the devtools on errors, Atom is constantly being fixed and improved, and I agree that it should be the default behavior.

But for users like me who are trying to give this awesome editor a chance, when working on a project (not working on Atom itself), the behavior of the devtools to pop on every single error is very annoying. I am aware that packages might have problems and they need to be fixed (or disabled to stop the errors), but since I'm working on a project I don't have the time to do this. If things get critical I might debug and start disabling and debugging every single package installed, but if you keep popping that screen on my face every single time I'm gonna ditch Atom for a long time.

So, after my whining, I propose this:
At least there should be an option to disable it, probably accompanied by a warning like ""procceed at your own risk, if Atom starts to misbehave, follow the debugging procedure described here >link<"".

PS: I searched through the issues and didn't find a similar request, only bugs that referenced this behavior. So, in case this is a duplicate, sorry.

"1901","Mouse click unable to move cursor after certain events","I've had a strange issue lately, and finally managed to reproduce it reliably. I noticed that at times I was unable to move my cursor around text with a single-click, requiring a dragging motion to actually move the cursor.

System is Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64, with atom version 0.126.0-f357f69, although this issue started a couple weeks ago.

The way I found to reproduce it, is starting Atom, click around on some text. Expected behavior here, cursor jumps around where you clicked.
Now after opening another pane (like a markdown preview in this case), clicking around on text will do nothing, requiring a click+drag to move the cursor, as little as possible, so you don't end up selecting text instead. Closing the pane doesn't return it to normal behavior.

I'd include a screenshot, but it would be superfluous as it's barely something you can ""see"", and it'll look like I am just clicking when click-dragging.
I've seen similar issues that might be related, but aren't exactly this behavior. Please let me know if this issue is more related to atom-shell instead.

EDIT: More information.
I use ""alt+space"" to open the command palette. I am having the odd feeling this is related to the alt key still being considered down after the pane creation. If I open the markdown preview via menu, it will not happen.
alt+tab-switching out of the window will at times cause this as well.

Because a lot of other menu items have keyboard shortcuts, I assumed that the items without shortcuts in the menu had no shortcuts by default.

Is there some API limitation that prevents chorded shortcuts from appearing in the menu bar?

"1909","Cursor's event 'moved' not triggered properly.","This issue can be reproduced as follows:

This code will move the cursor `right`, when it's `moved`

``` coffeescript
editor.cursors[0].on 'moved', =>
  editor.moveCursorRight()
```

If you manually move the cursor `right`, the event will be triggered properly and the cursor will just go all the way to the end of the buffer. It's all good.

if you manually move the cursor `left`,  the event will be triggered properly, the cursor will be moved back to where you started.

```
1. initial cursor position

   *
   ^

2. manually move left

   *
  ^ 

3. 'moved' triggered, cursor move right

   *
   ^
```

But then, when you manually move the cursor `left` **again**, the event `moved` is not triggered at all. 

```
4. manually move `left` again

   * 
  ^

```

I think it has something to do with the state of the cursor position, it is not modified properly when `moveCursorRight` is called, so when we move the cursor `left` manually again, the editor will think that the cursor wasn't moved at all.

This is how the Edit menu looks in Linux currently. It's perfectly serviceable, although the recent move of the Preferences entry in there looks a bit out of place.

## Bit of background: links to problems / talk about package writing
- http://gnuu.org/2014/03/10/my-week-with-githubs-atom-editor/

- https://discuss.atom.io/t/looking-for-best-practices-for-iterative-development-on-atom/10889
## Guides We Should Write
### Events

Events seem to be the number one issue folks have with the API. There is confusion around
- Which classes produce which events?
- What is the difference between events and commands?
- What is a subscription object? 
- Subscribe? on? which one? Where am I? It's dark in here!

This guide (and new APIs!) should address these things.
### Serialization
- WTF is it?
- How does it work?
- How to use it?
### Inter-package communication

(API needs to be written!)
- How to use
- Best practices
### Testing your package
- Setting it up
- Best practices
### Grammar scopes

Creating a language package? A syntax theme? It's impossible to know what scopes to generate / select for in common cases. What are the scopes for a function? Punctuation? Class names? I have no idea. Currently, the only way to know what to do is to look through several other lang packages and themes to get an idea of the scopes involved.
### Decorations

Currently the best docs are the example package and the blog post.

Cookbooks / Recipes (have not decided on naming) are small snippets that solve a specific problem. Often package authors (and me!) want to know ""how do I do That Common Thing that I saw in package Y"". They can also be an entry point into a related guide. 

This list should be exhaustive. If you have ideas, let me know and I will add them.
- Observing all the editors
- Observing the active editor / pane item
- Adding a pane item in a tab (like settings view)
- Adding a panel (like find and replace)
- Subscribing to a command
- Highlighting a line / gutter-number (decoration)
- Adding something to the status bar
- How to get user input (like jump to line)
- How to display a filterable list in a dialog (like command palette)
## Changes we should make to existing guides
### In [Creating a package](https://atom.io/docs/latest/creating-a-package)
- This could provide more of an overview and be the entry point / index into other guides (like the one on events or serialization).
- Section about activation events
## Less concrete ideas for guides

Here are some ideas from https://github.com/atom/api/pull/6 and from the summit that are less fleshed out. 
- Making your package fast: common pitfalls
- Debugging your package
- Package manager guide
- Theme manager
- Syntax/Grammar
- Editor
- Workspace/Panes
- apm
- ~/.atom
- cross-platform
- dependency management in packages (where do I get the things I need?)
## Updates

Writing these is getting closer, so I will be updating the body of this issue as comments roll in and we think of things.

"1938","Atom can lock files or folders under some circumstances","Instead of vaguely explaining, here are the steps for reproducing the bug:
1. If you have a Yeoman-created project folder i.e. `generator-webapp` created project, run `grunt serve`. It'll create a .tmp file, and I'll assume you haven't had one at first.
2. When everything goes well expand the folder .tmp in Atom so you can see the subfolders inside.
3. Stop the grunt process.
4. Run `grunt serve` again, and it will run `grunt-contrib-clean` to delete .tmp. 

It won't. .tmp will still exist as a ""corrupted file"" and you can't delete it by the Windows Explorer. Command line will show `Warning: Unable to create directory [path to .tmp folder]"" (Error code: EPERM). Use --force to continue.` when trying to create a new .tmp folder.

Go to Atom and try to delete it, and the Dev Tools will show the same error: `Uncaught Error: EPERM, operation not permitted: [path to .tmp folder]`. All you need to do is close the folder again on the sidebar to remove the folder. I also tried the same method to Sublime Text, and it doesn't do the same, so I assume there's a clash between `grunt-contrib-clean` and Atom's way of handling files.

Atom is 0.123.0, and Windows is 8.1. Command line running Grunt is running as Administrator.

"1942","Title-bar drop-down menus sometimes don't drop-down","Atom 0.123.0 -- Ubuntu/Linux 14.04 (Unity) -- bug

Occasionally (and I cannot yet tell what triggers this), clicking on a main menu title (e.g., File, Eidt, View, ..., Help) fails to drop-down the corresponding menu.  Instead, the windows underlying title (temporarily replaced with the menu-list when the mouse-cursor hoovers over) is flash-revealed in response to the menu click... and this repeats for each subsequent click _on that first-chosen menu title._

If you move to select/click an adjacent menu title and click, then that menu drop-down is realized... e.g., start by clicking on View, it flashes the window title, click again, another flash... move mouse sideways to Edit and click there, get the Edit menu drop-down, then without selecting there, move/slide back over to View to see its drop-down, and make your original selection.

This is not easily repeatable, and I cannot yet discern any editing action which precipitates it.  But it does happen frequently enough, though seemingly randomly.  Once a menu selection is made (somewhere!), it all seems to work again... for a while.  Then another random glitch.

Anyone have any ideas about how to help isolate this bad behavior for a fix?

"1943","set width of a individual character","I'm making a plugin to vertically align operators in the view of the code.

However, I'm not sure how to set the width of a specific character.

It looks like I can change the width of a type of character for a given scope using `displayBuffer.setScopedCharWidth`, but I don't think that the scope includes the line/column number or anything I could use to select a specific char. Also, the docs for the displayBuffer are pretty sparse, so I might be misinterpreting what this does.

"1948","Snapped Atom window does not resize properly after being displayed on an external monitor that is disconnected, OSX","I use an external monitor with my MacbookPro (OSX 10.9.4 Mavericks). I use this monitor as an extension of my desktop on the laptop. During the day I make Atom fill the entire screen (I snap the window, a feature I have enabled using BetterTouchTool). When I disconnect the external monitor and attempt to use Atom on the laptop's screen it is too large, as if extending off the screen. To find it again I have to click into Atom, go to the top bar, Window -> Zoom. Once I do this it properly fills (again, not fullscreen) the laptop's screen.

At first you might dismiss this as saying the 3rd party app (BetterTouchTool) is responsible. However, Atom is the only application that this happens to. I also keep Chrome and Outlook in the same - window filled via snap mode on the fullscreen. Both of these apps will extend too far, but the height will be correct and I can again ""grab"" the window by the window title bar.

Thus I am led to believe there is something going on with the window settings for Atom, but I don't know enough about this topic to dig any farther. I was able to replicate the issue on a co-workers Mac, but we have similar environments so I can't promise that this isn't being caused by something else.

Even more importantly it makes any kind of synchronized scrolling impossible, which is a feature many users want and I was going to implement.

EDIT: It appears that the `center` option can be used to solve this problem.

"1992","Missing menu bar on KDE if using icon-tasks plasmoid","Related to issue #3114 

Using KDE 4.13.2, on Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.
![snapshot1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/323651/3807925/7f4b555a-1c6f-11e4-824b-3c878f3343f4.png)

After commit 4a7e98e398422a5783d26d7a8944ec6e405bce53 , menus won't show in KDE4 if using the ""Icons-only task manager"" plasmoid.
This task manager identifies itself as an Unity component (as seen in here http://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kdeplasma-addons/repository/revisions/master/entry/applets/icontasks/unity.cpp) for compatibility purposes, such as displaying quicklists and counters. It doesn't however, interact with appmenus in any way. And it doesn't seem to request them either. (unity.cpp lines 34 to 36).
My KDE desktop is configured to show all menus inside applications, so there's no global menubar active. So, despite the menus being exported, they are never displayed anywhere. It appears to be mistakenly confusing the plasmoid's presence (in DBUS perhaps?) as a global menu.

Disabling Unity support in the plasmoid does allow Atom to show menus normally, as illustrated here.

Any way to attempt to prevent Atom from exporting its menus (blacklisting in Unity's dconf, environment variables, etc) doesn't seem to prevent the disabling of the normal menu.

Please let me know if any other information is required.

"1994","Add an option to disable ""quick jump"" between indents","In Atom, it's not possible to begin or end a selection at the midpoint of an indent, because the caret can't be jumped there.

My suggestion: leave the default ""as is"", but add an option to disable the ""quick jump"".

Because I use custom themes that are in the `~/.atom/packages` directory, all style information is lost when I launch in Safe Mode ... meaning I need to change my configuration when I need to use Safe Mode and then change it back when I'm done.

"1996","Make `editor:checkout-head-revision` redoable","Related to #3168 

Given that the standard keyboard mapping on all platforms is a variation on Undo, this command should affect the Undo stack as an Undo command _not_ like a regular command. To illustrate:
1. Executing the command  should revert the contents of the file to the last committed contents in Git
2. Executing Undo again should do nothing
3. Executing Redo should reset the contents of the file to where it was before the `editor:checkout-head-revision` command was executed

Also, the Redo command doesn't restore what was lost ... but Undo does ... which is confusing when this command is accidentally triggered.

We should probably display a confirmation dialog for this command to be certain it is what the user wants and since data loss (or perceived data loss) can result.

"1999","Make indent guides indicate changing indentation earlier","The current indent-guides _lazily_ indicate when the indentation level changes. By ""lazy"", I mean that the indentation guides keep showing up until a line appears with different content. Example of lazy indentation guides:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4427/3789451/b265f116-1aa3-11e4-91eb-123e73337590.png)

Contrast this to _eager_ indentation guides, which disappear as soon as they can:

Lazy indentation guides work well in curly-brace languages because there is content on the line to indicate when a block finishes. However, in CoffeeScript and Python, they don't work well because there is no closing brace, and we end up with confusing guides that don't seem to match up with blocks.

This issue is asking that Atom indentation guides are changed from lazy to eager. Another way of describing it is to change the indentation guides so that they end where the closing brace would be in a curly-brace language.

"2000","Atom erasing the content of files when there is not enough disk space","I have a hard time replicating this issue since it will require me filling up the disk again, but in a nutshell the problem is that when I edit a file in Atom, if the disk space is not enough to save it, I find that the file content is erased. 

This happened to me more than once (yeah I need more Gbs of disk space) so I can certify that it is Atom the one causing the issue. The issue appears whenever I edit the file, not when I just open it. The problem is not that Atom is not being able to save the file (that would make sense if there is no disk space available), the problem is that Atom _removes all the content_, and of course I'm afterwards not able to recover it.

I have no clue of why may this be happening

"2008","Move Line Down/Up Bugs","move-line-down (and up) seem to be pretty buggy (and slow).  I will try to summarize the different issues I've come across (some are enhancements depending on your perspective):
- move-line-down with cursor in column 0.  Then press undo.  The cursor will start going down below the buffer and exceptions will start being thrown from tokenized-buffer.
- Select entire penultimate line, won't allow you to move it down (whether or not there is a trailing newline at EOF).
- Moving folds will cause it to unfold (and generally cause lots of problems).  The fold markers can be corrupted if you try to undo.
- Moving lines past a fold can cause it to unfold and have issues.
- Slow with large number of lines (issue #3128).
- Only supports 1 cursor (issue #2470).

I attempted to rewrite the moveLineDown function, and solved most of these issues except for the undo problems (which became much worse due to my approach).  Generally, undo gets very confused if you have `selection.setBufferRange` or `editor.createFold` in conjunction with insert/delete.  The only reason I can see that rebuilding the selection or the folds is necessary is because there is no way to insert text just before the cursor without it becoming part of the selection or fold.

If someone can point me towards a way to insert just before a selection or fold without the text becoming part of that selection or fold, then I can simplify the code and not run into any undo problems.  Alternatively, perhaps it is a bug that undo can cause problems, but that may be more difficult for me to know how to fix properly.

I can provide more details or test code if desired.

If I compare the exact same operation with Notepad++, I can monitor these requests:

As you can see, Notepad++ goes a step further, and download the file.

I'm using the latest version of Atom provided by chocolatey (0.120 by now).

Let me know if I can help in any manner.

"2017","File rename issue","With Atom 0.120.0, on OSX (with case insensitive filesystem).

What I did:
First i left-click the file ""test.php"" in the Atom editor tree view to open it.
Next I right-click the same file and select ""Rename"".

What happens:
When i rename ""test.php"" to ""Test.php"", the opened file tab label does not update, and still says ""test.php"".
If I now click this file (to open it, it was already open in a tab) - i end up with two tabs, one ""test.php"", one ""Test.php"". Due to the case insensitivity of the file system I use, they happen to point to the same file.

What I expected to happen:
The opened file tab label to change to ""Test.php"" when i renamed the file.

"2018","Close all tabs but not the window","Atom seem to copy this very annoying behaviour from recent builds of Sublime Text 3 where it was in fact fixed in the latest build.

I propose `Cmd+Shift+W` to close all tabs but not the window. It is really annoying to close all tabs one by one before starting a new feature.

And even then `Cmd+Shift+W` in fact just closes window so when you reopen the project – all tabs stay and you have to close them one by one anyway.

Suggestion:

`Cmd+W` - Close tab
`Cmd+Shift+W` - Close all tabs but not the window
`Cmd+W` - Close window if there are no tabs left

"2029","Using 'sudo atom' can cause application errors due to root permissions on new compile-cache files","Just a moment ago I stumbled upon a similar issue to #3056. As a background: I do like atom so much, that I started it to use it as a drop-in replacement for gedit. Even to edit system configuration files. In this scenario it's quite common to invoke editors via sudo.

Atom will start in a broken state if you it was previously launched i.e with something like `sudo atom /etc/hosts`,  because in this case `$HOME` still points the original user directory, though the process is started under root privileges. This seems to be [a distribution specific default behavior of sudo](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/18399). 

As result **any file created** in this Atom session will become unwriteable for the original user and will lead to application errors inside Atom: 

```
[30615:0724/202223:INFO:CONSOLE(29)] ""Error: EACCES, permission denied '/home/ben/.atom/compile-cache/less/62b7a669af25a948e0632eac5cb2bf860f9c0e6e/imports.json'
```

To be honest: You are able run into similar issues on other programs too, but most of them tend not to create new files unless triggered. I'm not aware which actions trigger Atom to create new files under `$HOME` _after the initial first launch_ for a user.
### Steps to reproduce
1. Start `atom` and exit
2. `rm -r ~/.atom/compile-cache/less` to provoke Atom creating new files
3. `sudo atom` and exit
4. `atom`

This will be the case on all plattforms, where sudo keeps the original $HOME setting which can be tested i.e. by calling `sudo sh -c 'echo $HOME'`

"2038","Atom does not start after running once as root due permission of /tmp/atom-nohup.out","## Problem

Atom does no longer start after it has been run by root or probably any other user with a restrictive umask. This is because the `atom.sh` script pipes out the output to the same shared file  `/tmp/atom-nohup.out`
## Steps to reproduce

Run

```
 $ sudo su - root -c atom
 $ atom
 /usr/bin/atom: Zeile 84: /tmp/atom-nohup.out: Keine Berechtigung
```

The second call fails because nohup cannot write/access the file. This might work if root has a very permissive umask.
## Solution

Probably atom should create and use tmp-Dirs per user, which is common style in Debian or at least allow global writing on the lofgile (hacky version).

"2039","Make invisibles tab character span multiple spaces","In other editors I'm used to have a wide character (em dash) representing a tab and while Atom has something like that, it doesn't work quite how I'd expect it to work.

Currently, if you set an em dash in ""Invisibles Tab"" field and ""Tab width"" to 4 spaces, the em dash would be painted with the width of a single character. Here is a screenshot showing this:

![alt text](https://virtual-host-discourse.global.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/github_atom/23682/5e3564883ffa487d.png)

Note that the em dash should have the width of 4 spaces.

Brackets fixed this in a really cool way, VIM has it also. This way, IMHO, should be how this should work:

The ""Invisibles Tab"" setting should have 2 fields. The first field is for the character that should be used to fill the space of the tab. And the second field is for the character that should finish the drawing (if any).

Practical examples of this setting:

Example A
First character: -
Second character: >
Result for 4 spaces: --->

Example B
First character: -
Second character: -
Result for 4 spaces: ----

"2053","Chromium's font rendering color inaccurate","Font rendering in Chromium has a problem: the color is inaccurate. While it's not serious for a web browser, it's serious for a code editor. I was so frustrated when writing a syntax theme. Can GitHub do something to tweak Chromium's font color to what it should be?

To show everybody the problem, I made a comparison between 3 browsers. First, take a look at 13px font in Chrome (same effect as Atom). Left is black, right is rgb(0,128,0) green:
![chrome-008000-13](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731796/3636927/84ec4c5e-0fe9-11e4-9030-3946b770c852.png)

It's a little darker. What's the correct color? Let's take a look at Firefox and Safari's:

Firefox:
![firefox-008000-13](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731796/3636952/16ee5862-0feb-11e4-924a-531b0da204ab.png)

Safari:
![safari-008000-13](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731796/3636953/21753de6-0feb-11e4-94e8-95ea1506f344.png)

Chromium has a -webkit-font-smoothing css property, set to ""subpixel-antialiased"" by default. If changed to ""antialiased"", it becomes too bright:
![chrome-008000-13-antialiased](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731796/3636964/4ad44d5c-0fec-11e4-879b-04560558416e.png)

My conclusion is: whatever smoothing strategy I choose, it's inaccurate. Either too dark or too bright. It will become more serious if the font is even smaller.

Let's look at an extreme case (8px using default smoothing. not practical, just to show the problem):
![chrome-008000-8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731796/3637003/1c362b0c-0fef-11e4-8820-5680288feb41.png)
In Chrome it became completely black.

Firefox:
![firefox-008000-8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731796/3637018/de517a02-0fef-11e4-9a9d-42d65e6a1976.png)

Safari:
![safari-008000-8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731796/3637019/e6e1e012-0fef-11e4-8ea0-df4ac245ec95.png)

Before my test, I thought it's a Webkit problem, but now I tend to think it's a Chromium problem, because Safari is OK.

Update:
Seems it's caused by anti-aliasing. If you set `-webkit-font-smoothing` to `none`, then the color is correct, but the font looks ugly. Maybe Webkit has some internal parameters that control the anti-aliasing, but Chromium did not tune it to its best? That's why Safari's font color is OK? I don't know.

Update:
If React editor is enabled (default in v0.117), then it will be too bright rather than too dark.

"2056","Atom crashes when opening files","I've got an issue with Atom on OSX. Every time I attempt to open a file, a gray window appears and behind it a dialogue that reads ""The editor has crashed Please report this issue to atom@github.com"" appears behind it. (The file never opens).

This issue started when I attempted to open a file that did not appear immediately. I thought perhaps the window had opened underneath the current window that I was looking at, so I entered OSX's ""Mission Control."" While I was in Mission Control, the new Atom window appeared as a gray window over Mission Control. I exited Mission Control and the Atom window remained gray. I was unable to close that window and the editor was unresponsive so I force quit it. After that, all subsequent attempts to open any file in atom resulted in the gray window problem.

Starting Atom in safe mode seems to solve the problem, but I have no external packages installed, so it must be one of the packages that ships with Atom that is causing the problem.

This error consistently happens, but only if the fullscreen Atom-window is currently up on one of my screens. Whatever instance of Atom that is in fullscreen, but not visible at the time does not appear to display this bug.

Toggling both safe mode and the react editor does nothing to stop this form happening.

"2068","Make numeric keypad mimic regular keypad","I'm used to working with the numeric keypad instead of the 'regular' one. In all the editors I've used, the two have acted the same. 

In Atom, numeric keypad keys are recognized as separate keys and thus require their own keybinds. If one wants to use the numeric keypad, one needs to tediously add custom keybinds for everything from up and down to ctrl-home and shift-del. 

Is there a way to make the numeric keypad keys be recognized as their non-numeric counterparts, or, alternatively, introduce custom key-remapping?

Quickly searching through the code repo, I found out that this error message is generated by the handler of the `@browserWindow.webContents.on 'crashed'` event (in `/src/browser/atom-window.coffee`), but I don't know what could be causing the browserWindow to crash, since my teammates' computers are identical to mine, and they can all run it just fine.

I've just updated to version 0.115.0, but the error persists.

Thanks,

- Attempt to close the tab (for example `Ctrl+W`)
- Correctly, a dialogue opens, that will give you a choice how to proceed

![close-dialog-keyboard-lacking](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/124909/3550749/38cadc72-08dd-11e4-8d71-83e665a150cd.png)

**current (faulty) behaviour**

The Keyboard is pretty much useless for this dialogue. You can only Hit `[Enter]` to save.

**Desired Behaviour**

These interactions all don't work, but would be very much needed, all of these are very much standard behaviour for any application:
- [X] `[left]` and `[right]` should switch focus between buttos (so we can select a different thing with keyboard only)
- [X] `[esc]` should Cancel
- [ ] `[alt]` should bring up shortcut labels (much like it does for the application menu, i.e. _F_ile, which means press `[Alt+F]`)
- [X] `[tab]` should cycle between the buttons, `[shift-tab]` should cycle backwards.

1. Integrate with github's Git for Desktop.
2. Detect the user's msysgit installation WITHOUT using the PATH environment variable. First check the default installation location, and if it's not there, prompt the user to supply a path where it's installed. Call the binaries directly from that path.
3. Operate with an embedded version of git. This can be accomplished in the same way atlassian's SourceTree works: Download a portable release of msysgit, and use the binaries from that.
4. Operate without git integration and not complain.

The user should have the option to choose any of the 4 modes in the the settings dialog, and by default, atom should attempt to use them in that order.

This suggestion is mostly based on the windows version of atom, but could apply equally across all platforms with minor modifications. Remove the github desktop option, substitute msysgit for git, etc.

"2130","When building atom, the install directory should be configurable or installation should be optional","The default behaviour when building atom using `script/build` for platforms [other than Linux](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/8a377c9339d58ee3bdc42f7a38964362d2b4cdbd/build/Gruntfile.coffee#L228), is to [install to a pre-configured folder](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/8a377c9339d58ee3bdc42f7a38964362d2b4cdbd/build/Gruntfile.coffee#L45-L52).

It would be useful to be able to either configure the installation directory with an argument to `script/build` (eg: `script/build --install-path /some/path`) or alternatively, to either remove the install option from default build tasks or accept a command line argument that prevents installation (eg: `script/build --no-install`).

I think an even better option is for `script/build` to stick to just _build_ and another script (like `script/install`) could be responsible for installation.

"2131","Weird cursor position ","Since i'm working with Atom the cursor, sometimes, has a strange position. Mostly after autocompleting a function. I wanted to submit this issue for a long time but I can't reproduce the bug when I want to.

I disabled the autocomplete and autocomplete plus packages for a while and it didn't solved the problem either. I finally got a really bad screen capture .. and i'm still trying to figure out how to reproduce this bug. Take a look at the cursor position when typing.

"2132","Add quick skip next for multi select","When you're using the keyboard to do multi-select SublimeText (cmd-d on mac), you can skip the next occurrence of the selection with a hotkey combo (cmd-k, cmd-d on mac).  I find this immensely useful and would love if it was incorporated into atom.

I think done properly, this would be paired with a visual indication of where the next occurrence of the selection is (like the little outline around tokens you get when doing a text find (cmd-f) in atom), as is done in SublimeText.

More info on what's done in SublimeText here:

"2138","Unix process substitution displays nothing","[Process substitution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_substitution) is a feature common in Unix derivatives that allows one process' `stdout` to be fed into another process' `stdin` as a file descriptor. Here's the canonical `diff` example:

``` sh
$ diff -u <(echo 'Hello wrold') myfile.txt
--- /dev/fd/63  2014-06-28 23:41:39.000000000 -0700
+++ myfile.txt  2014-06-28 23:41:37.000000000 -0700
@@ -1 +1 @@
-Hello wrold
+Hello wrold!
```

(where the `echo 'Hello wrold'` can be any command, run within a subshell)

Thus, the following should work:

``` sh
$ atom <(echo 'Hello wrold!')
```

The expected result of this is that Atom should open a file descriptor containing ""Hello wrold!"" (which works in both `vim` and `nano`). While `/dev/fd/63` is successfully opened, the file is always blank (when run in `--safe` mode). No errors appear in the WebKit console.

"2141","shift-delete does not cut text to clipboard","In chromium and in almost every software I have encountered, shift-delete acts as ctrl-x -> it cuts selected text and places it into clipboard.

"2142","Handle line breaks for Chinese and Japanese properly in automatic wrapping","I've found two problems of Atom's soft wrapping:
1. Chinese and Japanese language does not use spaces to separate characters, it causes that Atom treats Chinese sentence as a extremely-long ""word"" and does not perform correct wrap. According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_breaking_rules_in_East_Asian_languages], a ""CJK Word"" is something like `(Opening punctuation)*(Han character | Kana)(Trailing punctuation|Traialing Kana)*`.
2. Atom cannot handle non-monospaced fonts correctly. Han characters and Kanas are much wider than Latin characters.

"2146","Calling setText() on Editor while it is not attached has no effect","I'm currently working with a View that has a mini EditorView as a subview. I'm trying to change the text in the EditorView while it is not attached to the screen. I've been debugging this and it seems that when I call this function: `editorView.getEditor().setText("""")` the `editor` member of the EditorView is actually updated and the text is changed to `""""`. However the problem is that the EditorView itself is not updated and it still shows the cached text the next time the parent View is attached to the workspace. 

Let's consider this example where I subscribe to a config change event. I added some variables so it's easier to understand what is what. 

``` coffeescript
@subscribe atom.config.observe 'ask-stack.autoDetectLanguage', callNow: false, (autoDetect) =>
      view = this
      editorView = @tagsField
      editor = editorView.getEditor()
      @tagsField.getEditor().setText("""") 
```

The `View` is **not attached (or visible) to the workspace when the event is triggered but has been created previously**. The next time the `View` is attached to the workspace I expect the `editorView` text to be blank. What really happens here is that the `editorView` is still showing the previous text (cached I assume). 

Just for the sake of giving more context here's what I get in the debugger:
![Debugger](http://i.imgur.com/m8D4V0y.png)

At this point the `editor` text is empty so this is what we should see when the `view` is attached to the workspace. But this is what I see: 
![Image](http://i.imgur.com/9ZXpODJ.png)

**Important**: When I focus in that mini EditorView the text goes away. I'm guessing this is because the editor is back to an active state and looks for the actual text and the cache is cleared. However I think the text field should be empty before having to focus. 

I also tried to call `redraw()` on the `editorView` after changing the text but **the editorView will completely disappear when calling `redraw()` while the view is not attached to the workspace**. That might be another bug. This is what happens if I call `editorView.redraw()` after setting the text (the 2nd EditorView or text field is gone):
![Image](http://i.imgur.com/jhIeEeU.png) 

A work around is to call `redraw()` right after the next time the `View` is appended to the workspace. However I think this should be done internally and not explicitly in the package code.

What is Atom stance towards ""sane defaults""? Could it be acceptable patch to have `.pyc` in the ignored files by default (thus giving better out of the box experience), or should things like that go to a separate package which all Python developers then install? (Though Python highlighter comes with the default installation.) I am not sure if I want to make a pull request on this, as I am not aware of the authors stance on the matter like this. 

For comparison, Sublime Text & co. seem to hide `.pyc` files by default.

"2187","text-rendering: optimizeLegibility causes erratic caret behaviour","Hi all,

If I apply the ‘text-rendering: optimizeLegibility’ directive to the stylesheets on .editor or .workspace, any subsequent command palettes, text fields or tabs have a visually broken/erratic caret:
- In text fields, such as the command palette or settings view, the caret appears before the first character even though it's actually pointing to the end of the text;
- Moving the caret left and right in an editor tab sometimes causes it to jump several places left and right of where it should be, there doesn't seem to be any discernible pattern and reloading the tab causes different breakages to happen.

This issue only affects new tabs/palettes created after the stylesheet change occurs, it seems.  Similarly, removing the stylesheet change only takes effect for new tabs/palettes.

Perhaps we could provide some syntactic sugar nicer than iterating over every EditorView, like say an object of path matchers and functions that get the current editor added to their context and run when initializing a new editor?

``` coffeescript
atom.fileActions = #terribly named
  '\.md$': -> currentEditor.setSoftWrap(true)

- Main editor window partially blanks out and a firebug window opens on the bottom third of the screen.  Firebug window is empty, scrolling in main window remains blank.
- I restart Atom, since this has happened before (seems like just a UI painting problem)
- Upon restarting, my entire project has been ""reset"" to an earlier version, perhaps several days ago.  I can only assume that Atom maintains a cache somewhere and upon crash decided to restore from this...instead of just leaving the files alone.
- Strangely, some newly created files (from tonight) remain 100% intact.  It's just the files that I've been editing for the last several days that were overwritten with a much earlier version.

I was just hacking around on my laptop and hadn't started a git repo yet, soo...Atom effectively nuked my project.

Atom seems to want to be the same thing for code editing, only allowing for all that extra customizability via packages and css styling etc...

Now that I have been trying both for the last few days, it seems to me a logical next step to open and edit files directly from the github client. I can imagine both: Atom being just another module or ""page"" inside the github client, or the github client gets removed and all its functionality integrated into the Atom tree view, via context menu entries or a second tree view pane with repositories etc...

Has any thought been given to this kind of thing?
I'd love to see that, and given Atom's extensibility, I'm sure a package is just around the corner.

"2216","Support configurable, non-uniform, visually aligned tab stops","I would like to raise the issue of configurable tab stops.

A proposal has been floating around the web for a few years, called [Elastic tabstops](http://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/), that promises to usher in the ""next generation"" of source code alignment.

It aims to make it easy to align code blocks and side comments, both for traditional coders using monospaced fonts, and for those of us who prefer proportional fonts.

It would also make it easy to edit tabular data, be it TSV (tab-separated values) or a table in Markdown or other markup languages.

I would gladly write an extension myself to realize elastic tabstops, but unfortunately it's one of those things that require a very specific feature in the editor component: **the ability to specify non-uniform tab stops, as a list of visual positions (eg. pixel or em, _not_ characters) that may be different for each line.**

Right now the tab support in Atom is just a trick (a span with a certain number of blank characters), it's not even a true tab stop, as is painfully evident when using a proportional font:

![screen shot 2014-06-06 at 15 38 14](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/48756/3200906/0830fd42-ed82-11e3-9b00-b39a15ac2fd9.png)

Seeing as work is currently underway to write the newer React-based editor component, I just wanted to throw this feature request out there to the clever people writing such code.

I'm fully aware that it is not a simple task, because it transcends the character-counting nature of the current code. Doing it without triggering a reflow for each tab stop (to query the current width of the line being composed) is even harder. It would require pre-caching the em-width of every character for the current font, or something along those lines.

But it's one of those features that would set Atom apart from any other editor.

Again, the tricky part is just the configurable tab stops. That would allow extension writers to align code, tables, and other data with various algorithms, including Elastic tabstops.

    'end': '$'
    'name': 'meta.preprocessor.diagnostic.c'
    'patterns': [
      {
        'match': '(?>\\\\\\s*\\n)'
        'name': 'punctuation.separator.continuation.c'
      }
    ]
  }
```

This seems to be a direct port of TextMate's C highlighting rules:

```
        {   name = 'meta.preprocessor.diagnostic.c';
            begin = '^\s*#\s*(error|warning)\b';
            end = '$';
            captures = { 1 = { name = 'keyword.control.import.error.c'; }; };
            patterns = (
                {   name = 'punctuation.separator.continuation.c';
                    match = '(?>\\\s*\n)';
                },
            );
        },
```

As far as I can tell it should highlight the ""test"" on the second line in the screenshot below in the same color as the ""test"" on the first line (and that's the result in TextMate 1). Comments in Makefiles are another example of the same behavior.

"2218","Numpad deactivated not working.","(Using windows 8)
I have a Sony Vaio S, and when I disable my ""Num Lk"" the home, end, page up and page down keys are not working. I need to use the Fn key and my arrow keys to get the functionality of these keys.

"2219","Themes are updated approximately 300ms after window focus/unfocus","This bug really becomes apparent with you use themes like `unity-ui`.

The theme lags behind 300ms after you focus or unfocus the window, and in the case of unity, the active tab background is not updated in the same frame as the window titlebar, which results in a ""flicker"". This is very visually annoying.

There are bugs similar to this on Phonegap, but since no touch events are being issued, I'm not sure why it even exists...

"2220","Sometimes gets stuck in snippets mode","Occasionally, tab stops being able to indent. I dont know what causes this, but I use folds a lot, so it might be related?? 

I did not use any snippets on this file. I 
- opened it, 
- folded everything at level 2 (`cmd-k-2`)
- arrowed around, 
- unfolded some things
- then hit enter a couple times after a folded row

Note the extra spaces after the expanded snippet and the last command being editor:indent.

Not sure where the issue actually is, though. Maybe this should be on the snippets repo?

I am using the react editor.

"2224","font-size weirdness / suggestion","This isn't necessarily broken, but just something odd I've run into. I teach a class, and use Atom for my editor to show examples of code. Since my code is being projected on a screen to a classroom, I have my font-size set crazy high. Like, ridiculously high. The issue is that when I create a new file or folder, the text inside that field is that same size in which no one is able to see what I'm typing.

Here is a screenshot of what that looks like. Maybe as a suggestion, that text field could remain a normal size?

"2225","Log error when a command fails","## The problem

When brand-new, like me, the problem could be anywhere, so I'm clumsily looking at **everything** to try and figure out where the issue is. All I can see is that nothing happens. The specific issue was that I had the command correctly loaded into the `activationEvents` in the json file, and my ""lib/my-project.coffee"" worked correctly, but I didn't have the `main` set up to load the file (because I generated it with `$ apm init --convert` to load my TextMate plugin rather than with `generate:package`).

I assume what happens is that when I run the command, it goes to find the command, which should be there because it is added in the `activate` key. But it is not there since the file did not get loaded. Because it is not there, it silently fails and removes the commands from the list of commands.
## The desired behaviour

Ideally, the system would log enough information for me to figure out where the issue is.

Keep in mind that I'm very very new so I have very little ability to troubleshoot based on reasoning about the system. I'd like to know it's not in my keymap file, it's not in my package.json. Something like this would be helpful: ""my-package:my-command was registered as an activationEvent, but could not be found as a command."" maybe also a link to common reasons this could happen such as: the command was never, the name is wrong (describing a way to see the list of registered commands in the given namespace would help a lot here), the file was never required, the file wasn't specified in the main command of package.json.
## Another Possibility

I don't know if it's reasonable to have .coffee files in lib without having a main in package.json, but maybe a linting of package.json would catch this? Or maybe there's a combination of things: files in lib, no main, commands in activationList. If this is something that could be caught, it would also be nice if it would run automatically on saving of package.json

"2236","Auto Indent should look further for a preceding line that is not '\n'.","As it stands right now, auto indent relies on the previous line's indentation.

In a situation where trailing whitespace is trimmed the previous line might be just a newline. The indentation of the current line is calculated wrong.

This is what currently happens:

```
void main() {

}
```

If the line between `int a = 0;` and `a++;` is a newline and not 4 spaces, then `a++;` won't be indented at all.

To change this behaviour, the preceding line should be compared with a newline character. If this line's content is '\n' the algorithm should continue upwards and calculate based on `int a = 0;`'s indentation.

    else
      @hide()

This seems to suggest to me that `atom.workspace.getActiveEditor()` is returning an editor with no cursors which might imply that is has been destroyed already.

It would be easy to check for this explicitly in status bar but the fact that `atom.workspace.getActiveEditor()` is return an unusable editor is worrisome.

"2244","Selections do not always disappear immediately, causing overwrites.","Occasionally when selecting text and typing over it, the selection remains and selects the next text of the same length (or sometimes one character). Because of this, typing over a selection causes the original text AND the new selection to be overwritten. In the case that the selection is replaced by the one character selection, typing continually replaces the same character until a delay in typing occurs.

The expected behavior is that the selection and selected text both disappear immediately when beginning to type.

What I would like to see is capabilities added for the following.
- Subscribe to package manager to get instance of package when it is loaded
- When loaded a subscribed package should expose instance of package created so sub modules can execute against loaded package, for instance if the workspace was a separate module we would get the workspace by subscribing to the workspace load rather than it being available globally on the atom object.
- Ability to subscribe to loaded packages by metadata filter, something like what atom linter does to find linters that have been loaded, but subscribed like we subscribe to all current and future editors.
- A simple interface for verifying version (via semver) of the subscribed package(s) are of the correct version, and when not alerting the user that the modules need updating.

This would give us the ability to dynamically, and bi-directionally link modules to each other.

Atom already provides a nicer more maintainable way for adding panes around the tabbed editors, it would be great if it also provided a way to do it for each tab editor.

This will make some packages easier to write and more stable as the DOM changes over time.

I closed the console and tried to select again. It wouldn't let me select or type or move the curser, but the curser was still flashing. I mashed the keyboard in an attempt to see changes on the screen. When nothing worked, I closed the file and it prompted me to save my changes. Figuring it just got stuck on a keyboard shortcut or mouse gesture, I said save and then reloaded Atom. On reload I opened my file and it was just 8 characters, which I'm pretty sure were the keys I mashed after the window was unresponsive ('asdfasdf').

The only indication that Atom had issues was the developer console popping up. But there was no error in the console so no indication that anything was actually wrong. If there were some kind of error message or warning I would never have saved my work.

"2285","atom should not override Cocoa text system's buildin word auto-completion","Mac  has a system-wide word auto-completion key-bindings: `command + .` or `F5`. The TextEdit.app and Mail.app and Chrome(omnibox, the address bar) and many other Cocoa App supports this feature. That is: you can input partial of the word, press  `Command + .`  , a auto-completion drop-down should be triggered,then you can select the target word.

This cocoa text auto-completion is very important for a foreign writers.

"2286","Default Directory ","I think it would be cool to have an option to set a default directory if atom is invoked with no arguments. If no value was entered then atom would behave as it does now. There was some talk about removing the Project Home option in the settings dialog but I would vote that it be changed to mean the default directory for projects. This way i just launch atom and I'll be staring at all my projects. I understand this can be done many ways, even with an alias. For now I added this simple hack to atom.sh just under the getopts section.

if [ -z $1];
then 
cd /dir/containing/all/projects
fi

I thought about just adding whatever file contains the ""Project Home"" entry as a source in atom.sh and calling the value here if not empty. Any thoughts on a more elegant solution?

Thanks!

"2287","[devtools] Debugging gets silently disabled","React editor. Happened while trying to debug #2186

1) Open up `app/src/editor.js` in _Sources_
2) Place a breakpoint on the first line after `Editor.prototype.insertText = ...`
3) Paste using `Ctrl+V`

This breakpoint should fire on every insert. Even if I stop trying to paste, and try to input a single character, insertText should fire, thus this breakpoint should too.

- Activate IME by keyboard shortcut¹
- Type something → **no output at all**
- Switch to some file opened in Gedit, type something → works
- Switch to some file opened in Atom, type something → works

"2307","Please consider adding an API in Atom that allows for interception of  the window creation process.","After hacking on Atom for the past week, I was able to simulate custom client-side window decorations (ala GNOME) and was hoping I could propose an official api.

My proof of concept is here (the hack was quick and dirty): https://github.com/nikolowry/atom-csd. 

The api could possibly detect if a global menu is present (Mac, Unity, Mate, etc), which would then ensure the original menu api functions as expected. However in OS's/DEs that don't use global menu's (Fedora, Ubuntu GNOME, WIndows, etc) it would both detach the menu and serve a frameless window.

Another idea could be to place some optional settings/flags in the api that would make the end-user ultimately responsible for choosing if they want a frameless window/detached menu or only the frameless window.

I have no qualms with writing a clean/modular/logical solution and issuing a pull request when I'm finished, but would only start with the blessings of the atom team.

Before writing this request for consideration, I made sure to check if it was possible to intercept window creation at run-time in the atom-shell and was informed it was not: https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/302

I know how difficult it is to optimize cross-platform and to propose custom/experimental designs/solutions in a corporate setting (regardless of whether said organization is horizontally or vertically integrated), and appreciate your consideration either way.

If we could implement this, Atom would surely become the ""champion editor"" for us developers that prefer to run a non-traditional-OS/DE.

Your support for either a full blown ""offical window theme api"" w default styles (ala the ui/syntax manager) or just a simple api intended exclusively for package developers, would be amazing.

Atom Version: 0.94.0-c79ef04 from [my own builds](http://blog.someguy123.com/atom-builds-for-windows/) running on Windows 8 (not 8.1)

I think the issue is caused when opening a big folder. Although I can't confirm this. If I open a source code folder from my desktop (atom on the right), I get the default scrollbars as it's not fully expanded in the tree when first opened as there are only 3 folders (at least not until I expanded them by hand). 

However (atom on the left) larger folders like my entire desktop fill the sidebar vertically, and seems to cause windows-native scrollbars to appear instead of atom-style.

Here's a screenshot to show the difference:
![Example](http://i.imgur.com/RHqVdSb.png)

NOTE: This may be related to the other scrollbar issue where the cursor goes invisible when resizing. Filed as issue #2165

"2326","Resizing sidebar gives invisible cursor","It looks like the Chromium build for windows is missing some cursors. I am on Windows 8 (not 8.1) using my own [nightly builds](http://blog.someguy123.com/atom-builds-for-windows/). Specifically I am on version 0.94.0-c79ef04

The issue happens when you place your mouse in the resizing area of the sidebar:
![Screenshot of Resizing area](http://i.imgur.com/dMLZ6r8.png)

This appears to be caused by Chromium missing certain cursors, including the default sidebar resize cursor `col-resize`. You can check this by altering the `.tree-view-resizer .tree-view-resize-handle` style. By changing the cursor to `pointer` or `all-scroll` we can get some form of cursor when resizing.

![Example of all-scroll cursor](http://i.imgur.com/mXAz5MY.png)

I don't know if this affects the other versions such as the Mac and Linux versions, but a possible fix for the Windows version would be to use the `e-resize` pointer instead of `col-resize` as I have gotten success from that:
![e-resize example](http://i.imgur.com/CDqzV9o.png)

If you click `Soft Wrap` from the settings view it doesn't affect existing editor windows. `window:reload` also won't toggle soft wrap. You have to close and then reopen the file. I assume this is because the editor's local soft wrap property is being serialized.

I have found a few issues with selections. Over the course of the beta a few have been solved but one remains, and it has an ugly cousin.

The simple point is that when making a selection, if the cursor (which still held down in  a drag) crosses over the gutter between the line numbers and the editor area itself Atom seems to take this as 'the cursor is at the end of the line'. If you move the mouse beyond this gutter into the actual line numbers, we're back to normal.

The ugly cousin is that if the line being selected is longer than the editor window (and there's no wrapping), thus selecting the end of the line would cause the editor to scroll, there's a nice back-and-forth game it likes to play.

I am currently unable to upload a gif, but see [my original post](http://discuss.atom.io/t/gutter-selection-bug/8719) for now if you want to see both of these in action.

Update: Gif!

"2362","Atom opens a new window for file that is outside of current working directory","Suppose that I open atom in my home directory. The working directory shown on the left is my home directory.
Now if I want to open a file that is not in the working directory then Atom opens a new window with that file and its directory. Same thing happens if I want to open a third file that is outside of those two working directories.

Is this the intended behavior? Because it's bugging me that I cannot open a file outside of the current working directory in the same window.

Also dragging the tab from one window to the other only creates an untitled tab in the destination window and the source tab remains in the source window. (I guess this is another issue, but it probably has something to do with Atom only allowing opening a file that is in the window's current working directory).

I try to build the Atom editor under windows. I have followed all steps at these guide: https://github.com/atom/atom#building

Now when I am input `script/build` it shows me an error:
`The command ""apm"" is either incorrectly written or could not be found.`

What can I do/What i make wrong? (I am using Windows 8)

> If you have opened up the Command Palette (Command-Shift-P) in Atom v.0.92.0, and then switch to another app, say the Mac OS X Terminal app to run something you've been working on, the Command Palette is gone when you switch back (this is also true of this ""Send us feedback"" drop-down pane). It would be preferable if, on switching back to the Atom app v.0.92.0, that the Command Palette were still open where you left it.

I've noticed this myself, but never fund it particularly annoying. Also, some other dialogs are affected by this as well, such as the fuzzy finder. Unsure if this is something that's handled on a per-package basis or in Atom core, so opened an issue here. :pizza: 
- It seems that SublimeText doesn't have consistent behavior with these dialogs -- the command palette is closed similar to Atom, but the fuzzy finder is not (it stays open even after the app loses focus).

"2403","alt-up/down doesn't do anything, and ctrl-shift-a is confusing","Halp ticket:
- support/d8c483c6c4af11e3900abd3beebdf506

Pressing `alt-up` and `alt-down` doesn't move the cursor at all, which isn't what some of our users expect. The same is true for `alt-shift-up` and `alt-shift-down`.

As far as I can tell, SublimeText3 uses `alt-up/down` to jump to the beginning/end of the line, and `shift-alt-up/down` to select to the beginning/end of the line. Might this be a good default in Atom as well?

This behavior of jumping to the beginning of the line is currently bound to `ctrl-a` (`editor:move-to-beginning-of-line`), while `cmd-left` jumps to the beginning of the physical line (`editor:move-to-first-character-of-line`).

However, `ctrl-shift-a` doesn't select to the beginning of the logical line but to the beginning of the physical line (`editor:select-to-first-character-of-line`), which is the same thing as `cmd-shift-left`.

In other words, if `ctrl-shift-a` was consistent with `ctrl-a`, it would select like this:

> It seems the Info.plist of Atom is listing an icon-file for every filetype, but none of them actually exist, which results in all files set to open with atom to have a blank icon.

Unsure if this is on purpose or not.

The user was using this string as an example `ג׳ג׳ג׳dwdwdww`

Here's a GIF of me pressing just the right arrow key to get from the beginning of the string to the end:

I manually downloaded 0.79.0 and happily chugging along. I discovered now that there's a 0.83.0 release. 

The file menu tells me it is ""Downloading update..."", but I never see the blue squirrel, and subsequent restart attempts don't bring me a new editor. 

Launching with `atom -f` does tell me the download finished:

"2437","Certain CSS classes in syntax tokens cause issues","Reported in https://github.com/atom/highlights/issues/2

"2438","CSS selectors are insufficient replacements for TextMate scope selectors","We've borrowed TextMate's scope selector concept, but since we're a web-based editor, we've gone with CSS syntax rather than TextMate's proprietary scope selector syntax to blend in with the web.

Unfortunately, CSS on its own doesn't fully support the concept of a scope. CSS is focused on identifying _individual_ elements, whereas scope selectors are focused on identifying _subtrees_ of the document, which could include multiple elements.

We've attempted to encode TextMate's `-` operator using `:not` pseudoclasses, but it falls down. Say we're describing the following TextMate scope in CSS:

```
text.html .meta.tag - entity.other.attribute-name
```

This basically says, I want this to match inside HTML tags, _except_ for inside attribute names. We attempt to translate it to the following incorrect CSS selector:

```
.text.html .meta.tag:not(.entity.other.attribute-name)
```

Say we're matching against the following scope chain:

```
.text.html .meta.tag .entity.other.attribute-name
```

We first try matching the `attribute-name`, which fails because no selector matches, so we pop it. Then we try to match the `meta.tag`, and this _does_ match, regardless of the negation.

So you see that TextMate's `-` operator really can't be encoded with negation. It's operating on subtrees, whereas `:not` operates on individual elements.

Not sure what the best approach on this is. Maybe we could watch for stylesheet changes and change the overflow property away from scroll and then back. But I'm concerned this could hose our scroll position. Also, _anything_ that's scrollable would need to be fixed.

Maybe we should do the following:
Get a report of all _system-defined_ shortcuts for the window.
Avoid loading bindings from `darwin.cson` that conflict with these shortcuts.

Seems like we need to add the menu items without bindings, get a report of what bindings map to which commands, then add the bindings for all items that don't conflict.

"2450","Atom needs a better security model","If we're going to add GitHub integration to Atom, we need to cache credentials inside the app. We had previously implemented GitHub auth for our Gists package, but we removed both the package and GitHub authentication from the beta release because we were afraid of providing GitHub credentials to every random Atom package people installed. We can't avoid this forever, though. To realize Atom's full potential, we need to solve the security issue in a robust way.
### What would the ideal security model look like?
- Every package is loaded in its own context.
- Every package's metadata includes a whitelist of the following:
  - Security-critical properties of the `atom` global requested by the package.
  - Security-critical built-in modules (such as `fs`) requested by the package.
  - Whether the package is allowed to load custom native modules.
  - GitHub permissions the package needs access to and any other credentials.
- When installing a package, the requested permissions are clearly presented.
- If a package attempts to reference or require a resource that isn't white-listed, the user will be explicitly prompted to grant the package that permission.
### How can we implement this?

There's a fairly mature project called [Google Caja](https://developers.google.com/caja/), whose goal is to allow multiple mutually-suspicious JavaScript modules to run on the same page securely. To support older versions of JavaScript, they employed a complex whole-program transformation to achieve this. But ES5 incorporates several standard features that allow a context to be secured by running a small JavaScript library called [SES](https://code.google.com/p/es-lab/wiki/SecureEcmaScript) (short for Secure ECMAScript).

My understanding is still evolving, but it seems like we should be able to run the SES script in a fresh context to tamper-proof any globals that we inject into it and secure them from malicious modification or any other kind of privilege escalation. To do this, we'd basically need to provide our own alternative module loading mechanism, which I  started experimenting with this weekend with a fork of Node's built-in `module.js`.
### What if we miss something?

Security is tough because you only have to screw up once to get exploited. We probably will make a few mistakes. But based on my reading about ES5 and the Caja project, security should be possible in theory. If we implement a security model that leaks, we can fix the problems as we discover them. But if we don't even try then things will never be secure. I think it's worth trying, then subjecting our best effort to an internal and possible external audit.
### What haven't I thought of?

This is all new territory for me. Let me know what I'm missing.

3. Select two random characters that occur more than once in the text (e.g., the ""em"" from ""Lorem ..."").
4. Press Ctrl-Cmd-G to expand the selection to all other occurences of those two characters in the text.
5. Notice that the cursor from the original selection (e.g., the ""em"" from ""Lorem ..."") flashed out of sync from the other cursors.
6. I've noticed that this happens intermittently. If you don't see the out-of-sync flashing on the first time, repeat steps 3 through 5 ten more times. You should see it happen.

> This is perhaps a BIG one that undermines the foundation of Atom...but I find it quite irritating after coming from Sublime: I would like to be able to drag random files into a project/Atom instance so I can reference code side–by–side. Currently if I drag a random file from the finder into an Atom instance it automatically opens a new instance with the folder containing that file as the project root. Since I like to code in fullscreen, this means switching between a number of fullscreen Atom instances to look at or copy snippets of code. This isn't a particularly desirable workflow.

> This is perhaps a BIG one that undermines the foundation of Atom...but I find it quite irritating after coming from Sublime: I would like to be able to drag random files into a project/Atom instance so I can reference code side–by–side. Currently if I drag a random file from the finder into an Atom instance it automatically opens a new instance with the folder containing that file as the project root. Since I like to code in fullscreen, this means switching between a number of fullscreen Atom instances to look at or copy snippets of code. This isn't a particularly desirable workflow.

"2495","Provide a ""untrusted html view"".","In addition to [locking down iframes](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/193#issuecomment-36634975) and [enabling CSP](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1682) I think it might be nice to provide a top level API that extensions can use to render HTML safely.  Extensions such as markdown-preview take a string of HTML and render it in a div within the main Atom UI.  As a result, the HTML is rendered in the same context as the rest of Atom (with Node integration).  While CSP should mitigate much of the risk associated with this, it doesn't totally solve the ""render untrusted HTML"" issue.  For example, user content could potentially still break the DOM of the main Atom app. So, we could just ask that markdown-preview use a sandboxed iframe to minimize the issues that could arise from rendering user provided content.  But, I was thinking it might be a nice API primitive if we allowed any extension to hand us a string of HTML and we render it for them. I'm not sure how extensible this would need to be (ex. does the rendered HTML inherit CSS styles from the outer frame, etc), but it does seem like a nice security API.

The result is that syntax highlighting doesn't work right.

There are a few other instances I've caught:
- text-overflow should be wrapped in .property-name, but gets broken into `span.property-value + span.operator + span.property-name`
- `100%` as a property value should all be wrapped in span.constant.numeric, and ideally the span around `%` should be a child, but instead they are siblings (granted, that one might be a bit idealistic)

Also note that repeating the command again after the third (incorrect) selection _skips the next three instances_ of `h3` (the closing tag of the ""Payload"" heading, and both occurances of the ""Headers"" heading), and repeats the same incorrect selection on the next `h3` opening tag.

I suspect this has to do with the number of files in the project since I see it happen a lot more with github/github.

Project find is still trolling me hard, frequently showing old content and deleted/moved files. It's also still a pain to bounce back and forth without tabs turned on. If there's already a ""Project Find Results"" ""tab"" open, why do I have to hit <enter> in the panel as if I'm searching again?

Note the following:
- When the cursor reaches the start of the initial line, the next leftwards movement jumps up an incorrect number of lines (should go immediately above).
- In the gutter, the soft-wrap indicator dots (if that’s what they are?) and line-numbers are completely out-of-sync with the contents of the editor’s buffer. For example, if I attempt to click my cursor onto the word ""Sorry"" a couple of lines above the one labelled as line 23, the cursor jumps to the end of the line labelled as line 12.
- (Not shown in the gif) I can’t click my cursor into any of the text with a dot in the line’s gutter. Doing so results in the cursor jumping upwards to the nearest line with a number in it’s gutter.

I’ve had soft-wrap enabled by default for a good week or so now, and haven’t run into any problems until now. I have no idea what combination of things led my editor into this state.

I manage them separately. When things are working smoothly I don't manage them at all.

Atom seems like it continues to tie the idea of splits, etc to the idea of buffers, and I don't understand why. I'm consistently frustrated by this, whether it's an inability to manage panes when there are no open buffers, an inability to unsplit panes, or the fact that a pane disappears when its last buffer is closed.

Other packages that want to use the status bar have a bit of an awkward time getting a handle on the `statusBar` object. For reference see: https://github.com/atom/grammar-selector/pull/2 Here's how it works now:

In the status bar, I do this:

``` coffeescript
statusBar = new StatusBarView()
atom.rootView.statusBar = statusBar
```

And in the package using status-bar:

``` coffeescript
# This is dumb:
createStatusEntry = ->
  view = new GrammarStatusView(atom.rootView.statusBar)
  atom.rootView.statusBar.appendLeft(view)

if atom.rootView.statusBar
  createStatusEntry()
else
  atom.packages.once 'activated', ->
    createStatusEntry()
```

I dont want to have every package author that wants to use something to the status bar to have to do this.
### Proposal

I want to have some mechanism in one of the readily available objects (`atom`, `rootView`) for storage/retrieval of arbitrary objects. This is generally what I want to do:

In status-bar

``` coffeescript
statusBar = new StatusBarView()
atom.rootView.setChild('statusBar', statusBar)
```

In the package that uses status-bar

``` coffeescript
atom.rootView.getChild 'statusBar', (statusBar) ->
  view = new GrammarStatusView(atom.rootView.statusBar)
  atom.rootView.statusBar.appendLeft(view)
```

If `statusBar` is already there, it calls the callback, or it waits til `statusBar` is available.

I have no idea what to call these functions, and have no preference which object it should hang from.

Feedback, please.

It will also not open using command p so it seems like the underlying file open is actually having issues, not tree view specifically. When this happens, other files will open. It only seems to effect some of them.

No error pops up but if I look at the console there are errors that happen each time I click on one of the files that will not open.

It'd be nice to see that stuff actually get stored in `~/Library/Application Data/Atom` on OS X. This is where common application data goes, especially device specific things.

A lot of the stuff inside `.atom` would be useful to sync across computers and in dotfiles. This includes app settings, plugins, etc. Environment things. 

It seems to me that state like window size (per project) isn't something anyone would want. Not to mention how often it changes.

I'd love to know if there is consideration being made about `.atom` and people putting it in their dot files. There is currently device specific things in there, as well as things you'd WANT to sync, like settings and plugins. It'd be a shame to just not be able to sync with dotfiles just because of the state that's being saved inside there.

To trigger the render process crash, just launch atom/master on windows and wait several seconds (everything appears fine until the atom crash dialog appears and the memory usage spikes in taskmgr). 

I can isolate this down to just loading three packages,  `autocomplete`, `archive-view` and `bookmarks`. However if you load these packages independently they work fine.

Unfortunately I can't seem to get a backtrace in windbg because chrome/brightray/atom-shell intercepts the crash before the debugger can grab it. So if I run windbg in `-I` mode it never gets opened. 

The other fun thing is that if you run windbg in the mode where it attaches to all child processes and launch atom from within it the crashes stop happening.

@kevinsawicki also notes that, the packages activate just fine if he activates one package per second using setTimeout.

@aroben suggested disabling breakpad as a way to allow windbg to be called but this is starting to get beyond my current windows abilities.

While I understand @nathansobo does not want the auto-complete menu to show automaticly it seems to be the most common experience and most likely the one we should start with, however, I think if its an issue it should be optioned-off if needed.

I think the auto complete should first show the 'suggested/most used' item inline with the lighter text so that it can be tab completed:

Secondarily we should show (fast) the drop down menu thats accessible using the up/down keys:

Now, if I change the ""e"" from the ""edit"" string of the link to a capital ""E"", it seems to interpret it as a constant or something and ignore the closing quotemark as the end of what should be green text for the string contents:

Note that:
- The internal string ""Edit"" turns purple.
- Everything else after the string turns green.

In a more real-world-sized partial, this is pretty annoying:

"2706","""Non-native"" Fullscreen on OSX?","This is not a huge priority and may even be a ""wontfix"" (which is completely ok)

Currently when using Fullscreen in Atom it does what nearly every Mac app does post 10.7, creates a new space, and goes full screen over there. 

This is a bummer since it kills your second screen, and any cmd-tabs will cause screens to flip back and forth. Also can't have a browser, Chat, or what have you up side by side with it, etc.

MacVim has this as an option (which I keep off):

If you're in the gutter it'll just select til the end of the line. Pull into the editor, it snaps to the cursor position. Oddly, if you start in the gutter, and pull up it behaves how you would expect (per the fix from https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/352  ?).

For vim it looks like:

"2709","Support for vim-style insert transactions","Vim has the interesting property that insertions are actually transactions. Batches of typing can be repeated, undone, and generally messed with atomically. For example:

`2iabc<esc>` will enter insert mode, let you type `abc`, and when you leave insert mode, `abc` will appear a second time, having been entered twice.

Much more usefully:

`iabc<esc><move around>.` will enter insert mode, type `abc`, leave insert mode, move to a new location, and repeat the last insert at the new location. Great for things like strings in tests.

I poked around at adding this tonight. Up in vim-mode land it's actually not that complicated, but  I ran into the weeds when I started to look at the telepath library SharedString underlying text buffers. It sure looks like these classes are just _aching_ to support this kind of thing, what with their patches and transactions, but the transactions I see in the undo history are all associated with particular locations.

Is it possible to expose the concept of patches somehow? Something like 'apply the patch in undo location `n` to the current cursor location'?

"2710","Upon initial file load, soft wrap does not wrap until window is resized when soft wrap is enabled globally","Possibly related to https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/858, if you enable soft wrap globally, it does not wrap upon opening a new file until the window is resized.

1. Toggle soft wrap via preferences (not meta-p)
2. Open a file which would require soft wrap, such as a markdown file

"2711","Native Menu's","After continuing to look through usability and discoverability issues and talking with other random Hubbers about Atom I believe we need to get the 'Native OS' menu items worked into Atom. 

I Say native because I think the styles and functions need to be native to whatever OS they are using, OSX, Linux (prob Ubuntu stylings) and Windows. These are some of the menus from another editor, however, I'm studying through the other editors to see which make sense for Atom. Please chime in on both the concepts of nav discoverability and each menu item.

- Edit
- Selection
- Find

What I'd like to do, is see that question in chat, navigate to the file and method in Atom (which I'm almost always using anyways, and Atom's navigation is way faster than the browser), select the code and get a link to github.com, with some keyboard shortcut or menu item, and paste it into chat.

The other user (which will now be referred to as the ""guest"") clicks on the link and opens a new window. As long as the following are true, they will wind up with a wind where they can type and they can see the other user's cursor.
- The guest and host must be logged into github.
- The host's project must be in git.
- If the project already exists on the guest's computer at `~/github/<repo>`, it must have been cloned from the same origin.
  - Your trees must not have diverged (IE you can't do clever things with rewriting history on the host but not the guest).
- If a project doesn't exist on the guest's computer at that location, it's copied from the host and saved there.

Also if something fails we need to explain how a user can correct it so they don't feel lost.

```
irection[edit source | editbeta]
Intelligence requirements are determined by a decision maker to meet his/her objectives. In the Federal government of the United States, requirements can be issued from the White House or the Congress. In NATO, a commander uses requirements (sometimes called 'Essential Elements of Intelligence (EEIs)) to initiate the intelligence cycle.
Collection[edit source | editbeta]
In response to requirements, an intelligence staff develops an intelligence collection plan applying available sources and methods and seeking intelligence from other agencies. Depending on the organization and its access, sources may include HUMINT (human intelligence), IMINT (imagery intelligence), ELINT (electronic intelligence), SIGINT (Signals Intelligence), OSINT (open source, or publicly available intelligence), etc.
Processing[edit source | editbeta]
Once the collection plan is executed and information arrives, it is processed for exploitation. This involves the translation of raw intelligence materials from a foreign language, evaluation of relevance and reliability, and collation of the raw intelligence in preparation for exploitation.
Analysis[edit source | editbeta]
Analysis establishes the significance and implications of processed intelligence, integrates it by combining disparate pieces of information to identify collateral information and patterns, then interprets the significance of any newly developed knowledge.
Dissemination[edit source | editbeta]
Finished intelligence products take many forms depending on the needs of the decision maker and reporting requirements. The level of urgency of various types of intelligence is typically established by an intelligence organization or community. An indications and warning (I&W) bulletin would require higher precedence than an annual report, for example.
Feedback[edit source | editbeta]
The intelligence cycle is a closed loop; feedback is received from the decision maker and revised requirements issued.

Say I try that in Atom. Say I'm tired. I use some fancy keyboardin' and I command shift kickflip left arrow. Know what happens? Whole gosh darn 4 lines be highlighted. And you know I gots the trigger finger, so that delete be hit right quick and next thing you know the whole gosh darn paragraph just go poof. Just like that.

I repeat those steps about 5 times before I says to myself.. self... that is a git darn bug if ever I did see one. And here we are.

"2802","Panes within tabs?","I have a Vim workflow that I am having trouble recreating in Atom. Most of my tabs consist of a split, for a file and its tests:

![srt_imports rb _github_talks_app_concerns_talk - vim](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/12676/896074/195b3ef8-fad9-11e2-8bcb-80e85ab7ab8e.png)

Thus I can `{` and `}` my way through tabs and `[` and `]` my way through splits within them, and all was right with the world. My splits are about keeping related files together, not separate panes or editors.

The modeling of `Pane` and `EditSession` doesn't really allow this right now. It's fairly easy to see a number of ways to do it, but I was stymied when I started to edit core stuff by things marked as internal. @kevinsawicki said to ignore that, so I'm going to slowly work on something that works for me. But he also said to make an issue, so here it is. I'm hoping that one of you core guys sees a super easy way to do it :)

"2803","Keymap Improvements","So @nathansobo and I were talking about how to handle complex keybindings for first class vim support during summit.

I've run into several issues while thinking about it. The first is issue are vim's `dd` and `d{motion}` (like `diw`) commands which ideally would have separate lines in the keymap file so users could remap them as they wish. Something along the lines of this:

```
"".vim-mode"":
  ""d d"": ""vim-mode:delete-line""
  ""d"" : ""vim-mode:delete""
  ""i w"" : ""vim-mode:motion-inner-word""
```

Unfortunately the keymap currently fires the first binding that matches. Therefore if a user types 'd d' it will trigger `vim-mode:delete` twice instead of triggering `vim-mode:delete-line` once.

Another issue I've found that I wish we had a way to do some basic globbing:

```
"".vim-mode"":
  '"" [a-zA-Z]': ""vim-mode:register-prefix""
```

This syntax would allow me to restrict the possible keys entered without exhaustively listing them. If it's easier maybe we could just accept regexps here rather than trying to create a subset?

Note: This is also required for `f` and `t` motions.

I'd like to hear what others think about these proposals.

"2807","Stop including bundled packages directly in the source tree","Currently, we store the packages that we bundle with the Atom binary directly in `src/packages`. It would be great to pull these out in separate repositories and reference them from Atom's `package.json` instead.

**But** in order to do this we need efficient tooling for running tests on all bundled packages when we change Atom's core APIs and editing them in situ.

We're thinking of some apm commands like the following:
- `apm update` This prunes anything in `node_modules` that isn't mentioned in `package.json` and upgrades/installs anything that is mentioned.
- `apm develop [package-name]` This clones, checks out the correct revision, and symlinks all Atom packages in the `package.json` or the named package.
- `apm outdated` This looks for any new published versions of packages mentioned in `package.json` and lists them. It might also be nice to have a command (maybe a flag to `apm update`) that automatically writes to `package.json` and pulls the updated packages into `node_modules`.

Upon digging in it appears that grunt-lesslint never worked with the version of async 0.2.6 (as it used 0.2.9 when added). So I'm guessing the thing to do here is to update async and less in atom (which will require rebasing nathan's forked less copy). 

Before doing that I wasn't sure if there was a specific reason that those two npms were locked at those versions and how you guys typically handled upgrading dependencies.

There are versions of it written for just about everything—including:
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime#readme)
- [Textmate](https://github.com/emmetio/Emmet.tmplugin#readme)
- [CodeMirror](https://github.com/emmetio/codemirror#readme)
- [Brackets](https://github.com/emmetio/brackets-emmet#readme)
- [All sorts of other editors](http://emmet.io/download/), including Coda, Vim, plain old `<textarea>`s and more.

I’ve been using Atom for so long now that I’d forgotten how much I depended on this plugin when I used to use Sublime. I saw that there is a repo for converting `.tmbundle`s to npm packages, but the textmate version of emmet is a `.tmplugin` so I figured that probably wasn’t going to happen. 

Basically I have no idea myself how to go about writing an Emmet package for Atom, but it needs to happen, and I think this would be a pretty important package to be able to launch with (and possibly include with Atom by default?). There’s so many existing implementations of it, and all of them are open source, so I figure it shouldn’t be _too_ hard to hijack code from one of them for Atom.

How can we make this be a thing?

/cc @gjtorikian because I remember him mentioning something about a version of this for Ace? That should also be something we let people have when editing HTML via dotcom’s Ace, by the way.

"2850","Indention off when pasting with autoIndentOnPaste: true","I have this in my config.cson:

```

But anytime I paste something that has a single line with `})`, the indention gets off one level after it. It gets off one line for each line that has only `})` on it.

If I copy this and paste it:

```
foo({

  another({

I get this:

```
foo({

The above GIF shows the following things in a loop:
1. Paste a UTF-8 character (the one found [here](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f512/browsertest.htm)) into Atom.
2. Pressing backspace once, the unicode character is deleted, along with everything else up until the end of the string.
3. Pressing backspace a second time gets things back into the initial state.

What should happen: The state you get into in step 2 should not exist. Pressing backspace after pasting in the symbol should take you back to the pre-paste state.

To reproduce:
1. Launch Atom; an empty Atom with no open buffers is fine.
2. Choose Restart from the Apple menu.

Atom quits immediately, but the system restart aborts and displays the above dialog.

Also, this acts like choosing Quit from the Atom menu, which means that if you have unsaved but modified buffers, you lose them without a confirmation (cc #492).

I would have expected this to be pasted as individual lines and to not have split highlighting.

The text pasted was:

```
Assessment:  Friendly discussion with local contacts to assess whether the subject has information of value and to identify any personal attitudes, beliefs, problems or needs that could be exploitable. 

Elicitation:   A ploy whereby seemingly normal conversation is contrived to extract intelligence information of value.  Advantages of this technique are: (1) Puts someone at ease to share information, (2) Difficult to recognize as an intelligence technique, and (3) Easily deniable. 

Eavesdropping:  Listening to other people’s conversations to gather information. Frequently employed in social environments where attendees feel comfortable, secure and, therefore, more likely to talk about themselves or their work. Frequent venues include restaurants, bars, and public transportation. Eavesdropping can occur in a radius of six to eight seats on public transportation or ten to twelve feet in other settings. 

Technical Eavesdropping:  Use of audio and visual devices, usually concealed.  This technique is relatively cost efficient and low risk.  Concealed devices can be installed in public and private facilities, such as hotel rooms, restaurants, offices, and automobiles. 

Bag Operations:  Surreptitious entry into the subject’s hotel room to steal, photograph, or photocopy documents; steal or copy magnetic media; or download files from laptop computers.  Often conducted or condoned by host government intelligence, security services, or operatives for local corporations.  Frequently done with cooperation of hotel staff. 

Surveillance:  An act of following the subject to determine contacts and activities.  This method is labor intensive, if done correctly, and not usually employed unless suspected of improper activity or a target of great interest. 

Theft of Information:  Stealing of documents, briefcases, laptop computers or sensitive equipment.  Laptop computers are especially vulnerable as they may contain key information.  Foreign service has plausible denial since the laptop may have been stolen for the value of the laptop rather than the value of information.  This makes it difficult to determine if the information was compromised or not. 

Intercepting Electronic Communications:  Method of electronically monitoring telephones, facsimiles, and computers.  Subject is particularly vulnerable while communicating to, from or within foreign countries, as most foreign telecommunications systems cooperate with their country’s security service.  Office, hotel, and portable telephones (including cellular) are key targets.

I often try to match puppet module files with the fuzzy finder. These files are located on disk here:

```
modules/foo/manifests/bar.pp
```

They're referred to in code as classes like this:

```
foo::bar
```

So my use case here is typing `foo/bar.pp` into the finder and attempting to match on the basename.

For example, typing `github/god.pp` into the Finder used to bring up `modules/github/manifests/god.pp` as the first hit. Now it seems to prefer
`modules/god/manifests/init.pp`.

"2871","Moving cursor with status bar enabled repaints the whole screen","Some time ago, @kevinsawicki and I discovered that the entire screen was repainting whenever the cursor moved. We tracked the issue down to updating the cursor position text in the status bar, which was combining with the legacy flexbox implementation to cause the entire screen to relayout and repaint. When we upgraded to the new flexbox spec implementation, the issue went away. We concluded that the newer flexbox code must have been smart enough to know that the rest of the elements hadn't changed and didn't need to be repainted. At some point since then, the situation has regressed.

With the show-repaint-rects option enabled in the dev tools, here's what it looks like to move the cursor without the status bar enabled:

Note the multiple colored outlines around various lines. These indicate that the lines are being repainted two-at-a-time due to the line-highlight class being added and removed. This is the repaint you would expect and is extremely low-overhead.

Now with the status bar enabled:

![screen shot 2013-05-10 at 3 14 58 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1789/490324/26f744fc-b9b7-11e2-8cf5-f3cbf55dc633.png)

Note that now there is _only_ a colored outline around the entire window, indicating that everything has been redrawn. This takes way longer and hurts performance a lot.

I checked out the commit in which Kevin and I made the change, just to make sure I'm not crazy. I had some other issues getting anything but an untitled buffer to load, but the repainting works properly with the status bar enabled:

![screen shot 2013-05-10 at 3 36 19 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1789/490390/d1fffa40-b9b9-11e2-8dbc-3c0e8d3f2ecf.png)

I'm not exactly sure when this went bad. It's expensive to bisect because of the various versions of cef and cefode I would need to download. My theory is that something changed in webkit to make it slow again.

Perhaps this will change again when we switch to a newer version of Chromium with atom-shell. If not, @zcbenz, do you think this is something you could investigate in the Chromium source code? It would be great to understand if there's an approach we can take to limit repaint or if there's an optimization that could be added to webkit to avoid the issue. If anyone on our team can figure it out, it's you.

To reproduce:
- Start a new buffer and add some sample Markdown, including a link
- Activate Markdown preview pane
- Click dat link

I would expect clicking the link to either stay within the preview pane (might be tricky as there is no navigation in the frame after you go to the target link), open in an external browser, or simply to do nothing. With the current behavior, I need to close and relaunch Atom to get back to editing, as doing cmd-r to refresh just reloads the existing pane that now has a webpage.

"2892","Better cursor movement with line wrap behavior","In situations where you have line wrapping enabled and a ""real line"" is spanning more than one ""virtual lines"", there should be a way to easily get to the end of the virtual line as well as the real line.

Given this scenario:

```
+this is a line with a=
soft line wrap that=
spans multiple=
virtual lines
```

where the = is a soft line wrap and the + is the cursor, you should be able to easily get to the end of line 1 or line 4. Right now what happens is if you press `meta-rightarrow` you end up like this:

```
this is a line with a=
soft line wrap that=
spans multiple=
virtual lines+
```

If you press `ctrl-e`, you end up like this:

```
this is a line with a=
soft line wrap that=
spans multiple=
virtual lines+
```

I like SublimeText 2's way of handling this (and then we could make it customizable). `meta-rightarrow` takes you to the end of the virtual line and `ctrl-e` takes you to the end of the real line.
#### meta-rightarrow

```
this is a line with a+=
soft line wrap that=
spans multiple=
virtual lines
```
#### ctrl-e

```
this is a line with a=
soft line wrap that=
spans multiple=
virtual lines+
```

Users could then flip them or make it so both keystrokes do the same thing.

"2893","singleTrailingNewline takes focus unexpectedly","#399 discussed giving Atom the ability to automatically add a trailing newline, which is awesome. What I find very annoying is the fact that it automatically focuses the newline when it adds it. So, for example, let's say I have two lines of text in a new file:

```
this is line one
this is line two+
```

The + is where the cursor is. Now let's say I save. What I end up with is this:

```
this is line one
this is line two
+
```

when what I expected was this:

```
this is line one
this is line two+

```

Any way we can change this behavior?
","bug"
"2894","Idea: Allow `require` to supply scripts with fake global variables","Because we're mixing a Node-style synchronous require model with a lot of JavaScript that was designed to run into the browser, we often need to modify scripts that expect certain global variables to be present. For example, jQuery UI expects jQuery to be available in its global namespace, and fails when we require it currently.

It would be nice if we could somehow supply a hash of ""globals"" that we close over when evaluating scripts that we require, like this:

``` coffee-script
jQuery = require ""jquery""
require ""jquery-ui"", { jQuery }
```

Any free-variable references to jQuery would then be resolved to the passed-in object. One issue with this is the following: what happens when you call require again with different values for the same variables. Should we return the cached value? I'd say we make the caching conditional on the value of the variables, or just throw an exception if it's called a second time with different values. This would also require some modification to Node.

I'm not totally sure it's a good idea, but it might be a nice general solution to what will likely be a very common problem in the early years of Atom. If we become popular enough, people will start writing their JS libraries to run in both modes, but until then it would be nice to have something to help us paper over the awkwardness.

@zcbenz Thoughts on implementing this?

I had modified the feature flag in the main file (but not yet saved that change to disk), and proceeded to do a project-wide search for where that feature flag was used. The results contained the unsaved modification, despite it not matching the searched-for-text:

I’m imagining what’s happening here is that the search finds a match in the file as it exists on disk, but Atom displays that result with the unsaved modification in place of the actual match. I’m not entirely sure what _should_ happen here, but it certainly created a moment of uncertainty in my mind about why a result was turning up that I didn’t search for. Probably the best thing to do would be to show the matched result as it appears on disc, and have a ""unsaved changes"" label or something next to the filename in the result list? I don’t really know :confused:

- Check out a repo

For what it's worth, @atmos isn't having the same problem using an older atom. This could maybe be due to something else specific to my dev machine? If so, I could use some help diagnosing it so that we can maybe get some useful information about the behavior.

## In Depth Introduction to the Cyber Kill Chain
[Lockheed Martin | Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf)

> Conventional network defense tools such as intrusion detection systems and anti-virus focus on the vulnerability component of risk, and traditional incident response methodology presupposes a successful intrusion. An evolution in the goals and sophistication of computer network intrusions has rendered these approaches insufficient for certain actors. A new class of threats, appropriately dubbed the “Advanced Persistent Threat? (APT), represents well-resourced and trained adversaries that conduct multi-year intrusion campaigns targeting highly sensitive economic, proprietary, or national security information. These adversaries accomplish their goals using advanced tools and techniques designed to defeat most conventional computer network defense mechanisms. Network defense techniques which leverage knowledge about these adversaries can create an intelligence feedback loop, enabling defenders to establish a state of information superiority which decreases the adversary’s likelihood of success with each subsequent intrusion attempt. Using a kill chain model to describe phases of intrusions, mapping adversary kill chain indicators to defender courses of action, identifying patterns that link individual intrusions into broader campaigns, and understanding the iterative nature of intelligence gathering form the basis of intelligence-driven computer network defense
(CND). Institutionalization of this approach reduces the likelihood of adversary success, informs network defense investment and resource prioritization, and yields relevant metrics of performance and effectiveness. The evolution of advanced persistent threats necessitates an intelligence-based model because in this model the defenders mitigate not just vulnerability, but the threat component of risk, too.

When I copy a whole line, including the indenting whitespace, or multiple whole lines, from column 0 to the end including the newline and paste it at column 0 on another line, it strips the whitespace in front of every line and pastes it without the indentation.

For example, if I cut this:

```
no spaces in front

I would prefer my whitespace selection was honored and the whole line, including indenting whitespace, to be pasted verbatim.

I got down to hacking the application `open:path pidToKillWhenWindowCloses:pid` method. But I couldn't figure out how to open a file in an existing window. It probably requires some new Obj-C to JS bridge call.

https://github.com/github/atom/blob/dev/native/atom_application.mm#L144-L158

So, I read that, I open Atom and my first thought is, where is `meta`? I'm a vim user, so for me it would be `,` or `Ctrl`, but I'm on mac, so following the OS conventions I could thought that `meta` is `Cmd`. But, does Atom follow the OS conventions?

I just tried viewing a 350MB log file and Atom locked up immediately -- the file selector didn't change and the entire window went completely white 4 seconds after I tried viewing the file. I could still close the top level window, but we should still have better handling for this kind of thing.

"2952","Support image viewing","It would be awesome if you could click an image in the treeview and it's rendered inside Atom.  Most editors fail miserably at this.  Sublime renders the raw image data and Atom currently just shows the file extension or type.

"2954","Browser resource loading should respect the load path","Currently, we have a load path that `require` uses to resolve paths to script files, and we also use this load path in `requireStylesheet`. But resource references in the HTML such as images or fonts don't respect this load path... they are just loading relative to the page's static path on disk. I'd like the browser component to respect the same load path that require does, so that we can resolve relative resource paths to a variety of locations. This will allow themes and packages to easily pull resources that they package for themselves.

"2955","A wild phantom caret appears","So I have no idea how this happened, but just now I wound up with a second input caret that isn’t part of the whole multiple cursor functionality thing. It just sits there, blinking soullessly at me, regardless of what I do with the normal caret. An GIF:

![atom-phantom-caret](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/296432/106862/1baa004a-6a10-11e2-97a2-866c1bcc623d.gif)

Note that:
- it doesn’t move or alter text the way it should if atom was in multiple cursor mode.
- Adding to the start of the phantom cursor’s line does not increment the caret position.
- moving the real caret over the phantom caret does not clear it.

Switching to a different tab and back again cleared it for me.

"2956","ctrl-k semantics and no ctrl-y","Text entry areas on OS X implement a few readline/emacs keystrokes, including ctrl-k for ""kill to end of line"" and ctrl-y for ""yank from kill buffer"". I use them both a lot and in particular, this is the behavior I expect:
- Cutting a line with ctrl-k goes into the undo manager, but not into the system pasteboard:
- Text cut with ctrl-k can be pasted with ctrl-y to any other window in the same application, but the ctrl-k buffer is per-application

In other words, you can't command-v something you've cut with ctrl-k, and the ctrl-k kill buffer is application-wide.

Right now ctrl-k is bound to `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` in the emacs keymapping, but it affects the global pasteboard and there's no ctrl-y counterpart. 

It might be worth adding a ctrl-y mapping and changing ctrl-k/ctrl-y behavior to make Atom seem more native on Mac.

@probablycorey pointed me in the direction of `suggestedIndentForBufferRow()` and when I get time i'll probably try using that in a function in my own atom config, but i think it's a generally useful feature.

","bug"
"2960","Indicate ""searching"" state in places like ""Find across whole project""","When you pull up the command palette to do a search through the whole project (i.e. `cmd+shift+f` or by entering `:Xx/…` manually), there is no visual indication that once you’ve pressed enter it’s actually doing anything. I’m not sure how best to solve this visually—but my initial gut feeling would be to try maybe having the results pane show up, but to have it contain a message like ""searching now..."".

It may also be worth allowing people to cancel/abort a project-wide search, because they may have inadvertently done global find instead of ""find in this file"" (or maybe they meant to use the fuzzy file finder instead) or something.

Thoughts?

"2961","Atom's duplicating indented lines.","I had a line over 80 characters, I added a newline and realigned the code. 
I then changed another parameter and the line (the one I originally added the newline to) is again over 80 characters. I added another newline but this time atom duplicated the line below it!

``` command-line
$ atom bootstrap --package --name=MyPackage
```

This could generate the basic structure for a packages and export the top-level module in your index.coffee file. 

``` command-line
$ atom bootstrap --theme --name=MyTheme

This could generate the basis for a theme which contains all the proper theme files with empty selectors for every piece of atom.

"2963","Consider using nak instead of ack","Ok, so I'm sitting in Summit and blown the :shit: away by what you guys just showed. The funny thing is, after leaving Cloud9, I toyed with the idea of creating my own text editor with another friend.

Tangential to all that, I wrote my own Find-in-files/search-files module written in Node.js. It's heavily inspired by ack (which you're using) and ag. And it's fast as all hell: https://github.com/gjtorikian/nak (benchmarks available at the bottom) My ultimate goal was to be faster than ack, which I succeed by a large magnitude. 

The tool is _so badass_ that it's also touted on the official ack page: http://betterthangrep.com/more-tools/

At Cloud9, I worked on the backend search implementation, and here's the (long-winded!) discussion on how I moved from ack (in Perl) to ag (in C) to nak (in Node.js): https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9/pull/2369

If this is something you're interested in using for 0.1, I'll make the PR for the code.

notify = require ""notifications""

notify.send
  ""title"": ""The file has unsaved properites""

  ""click"": ->

"2969","Don't consider _ part of a word","In Atom if I type `def_unkt` and hit option-d, it deletes everything.

If I type `def-unkt` and hit option-d, it deletes `unkt`.

I always love when `_` and `-` are treated the same by the editor because in programming they are often used similarly:

`RATE_OF_CHANGE` vs `rate-of-change`

Is this something we can change in Atom?
","enhancement"
"2970","Fullscreen cmd+n opens fullscreen window","Right now if you have Atom fullscreen'd in OS X and hit cmd+n, a new fullscreen window opens. It'd be great if a normal, non-fullscreen window opened instead. 

Because Atom is project based making a window fullscreen feels like you're making the specific project fullscreen, not Atom itself. So it's weird that the fullscreen status is not local to the project but universal to the application.

I'm not sure if that's against OS X rules or whatever but it sure would be neat.
","enhancement"
"2971","Buffer mode map","It'd be nice to be able to define an arbitrary regex to match on a filename that determines which ""mode"" that editor should be in.

For example, here's some code from my Emacs config:

``` lisp
(defun make-auto (pattern mode)
  ""Add a pattern to the auto-mode alist.""
  (let ((ans (assoc pattern auto-mode-alist)))
    (if (and ans (equal mode (cdr ans)))
      (print ""Do Nothing"")
      (print ""Added"")
      (setq auto-mode-alist
      (cons (cons pattern mode) auto-mode-alist)))))


(make-auto ""\\.clj$""                        'clojure-mode)
(make-auto ""\\.pp$""                         'puppet-mode)
(make-auto ""\\.feature$""                    'feature-mode)
(make-auto ""\\.\\(md\\|mkdn\\|markdown\\)$"" 'markdown-mode)
(make-auto ""\\.mustache$""                   'mustache-mode)

"2972","""Shell"" mode","Emacs allows you to run interactive interpreters inside of a buffer. In particular, this is handy with things like a plain shell like Bash, but also works with things like IRB.

Emacs even has keybindings to allow you to execute parts of a buffer inside the related interactive shell.

I'd love to see an extension that would allow running a shell inside a new split.
","enhancement"
"2973","Prompt to create new file if no match found in fuzzy file finder","Basically if a path input into the fuzzy file finder does not have a match, add an ""entry"" to the autocomplete list to create a new file.

This would then open up a new buffer that upon save will actually persist something to disk at that file path.
","enhancement"
"2974","Scratch buffers","Emacs has a really useful buffer opened by default (and the default buffer view if emacs is ran without any arguments for a file or directory) called `*scratch*`.

Not only is this buffer a great place to just store text temporarily, but the really power is that it is an Emacs Lisp buffer designed to allow you to write code and execute within the running context of the editor.

I'd love to something similar for Atom, with keybindings to ""run"" a selected region.
","enhancement"
"2975","Ability to close splits independent of closing buffers","I talked with @nathansobo a bit about this in Kona. Basically, one of Emacs' best features is it doesn't couple splits to buffers, which makes opening and closing splits really powerful.

What I'm proposing is:
- Decouple buffers from splits on the backend
- Maintain the current Cmd-W behavior (that closes buffers and then eventually a pane)

This way the crazy Emacs-loving types like myself don't get frustrated with the splits, but the ST2-style behavior can remain default for everybody else. 

Here's basically what I'm proposing to be able to do, in slightly Emacs-ish terms:

```
window.keymap.bindKeys '*',
  'ctrl-x 0': 'editor:close-current-split-unless-last-split'

window.keymap.bindKeys '*',
  'ctrl-x 1': 'editor:close-all-splits-except-selected-split'

window.keymap.bindKeys '*',
  'ctrl-x 2': 'editor:split-down'

window.keymap.bindKeys '*',
  'ctrl-x 3': 'editor:split-right'

window.keymap.bindKeys '*',
  'ctrl-x 5 2': 'core:open-new-editor-for-selected-project'

  'ctrl-x 5 0': 'core:destroy-editor-unless-last-window'
