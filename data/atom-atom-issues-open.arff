'Customize presence absence ignored of final EOL',' mcandre commented on Feb 25 2018 3 01 AM UTC Proper LF text files feature a final EOL terminator at the end and even CRLF files benefit from a final EOL terminator For example C C h headers and js client code may break when a final EOL is absent due to the way that these files are concatenated Some formats such as GNU Makefile s require a final EOL terminator To help the user safeguard against these kinds of surprises it would be helpful if line ending selector offered an additional setting to manage this Aside from the choice of line sequence LF CRLF CR etc the user should be able to select a default and per file setting of EOL Present EOL Absent EOL Ignored This way sensitive text files are sure to feature the right end of file terminator This issue was moved by jasonrudolph https github com jasonrudolph from atom line ending selector 53 https github com atom line ending selector issues 53 ',enhancement
'Intelligent defaults based on mimetype',' mcandre commented on Feb 25 2018 3 08 AM UTC The current settings menu for line ending selector is fairly flexible allowing users to default to either UNIX style LF line endings or Windows style CRLF line endings for new text files However I think we can do better Regardless of default line ending value start new UNIX specific files in LF mode sh bash profile etc Regardless of default line ending value start new Windows specific files in CRLF mode bat cmd ps1 vbs cs fs etc This way users can be sure to use an appropriate line ending format for critical file types while using their preferential default of LF CRLF for non specific files txt md py etc This issue was moved by jasonrudolph https github com jasonrudolph from atom line ending selector 54 https github com atom line ending selector issues 54 ',enhancement

'Allow converting line endings for multiple files in project',' RichyHBM commented on Oct 31 2016 9 24 PM UTC It would be great to have the ability to convert files from the project side view maybe by right clicking on the file and selecting convert line endings If you were to do so on a file the default behaviour could happen opening the file in the editor view and changing the endings without saving But doing so on a folder should prompt the line ending to convert all files bellow that folder to this could then auto save or batch open all the files in editor and convert the endings without saving the user could then click on close alll and hit save for all of the files This issue was moved by jasonrudolph https github com jasonrudolph from atom line ending selector 34 https github com atom line ending selector issues 34 ',enhancement

'Atom s UX problems',' Summary Here a few UX problems that aren t really bugs nor feature requests but can still negatively impact a user s experience I ll keep adding more when something comes to mind Also feel free to comment below but keep in mind that this issue is not meant to brainstorm solutions and only focuses on the problems first If we want to improve something an RFC should be proposed Can t quickly switch projects When wanting to switch to another project Atom opens a new window which takes a while And you also have to close the current window Also the new window size and placement could be different and might need adjustment Workaround You could re use the same window by removing and adding root folders in the tree view but that feels tedious Use packages like project plus https atom io packages project plus project jump https atom io packages project jump project switcher2 https atom io packages project switcher2 No way to limit the scope to a single root project When having multiple root projects find and replace or fuzzy finder always search in all projects But sometimes you might want some projects not to be active and just use as reference Similar issue https github com atom github issues 1676 https github com atom github issues 1676 Workaround Temporarily remove and then after the search add the removed projects back again Autocomplete is not auto enough When Autocomplete shows several options the order is chronological If the option you want is not near the top you have to spell it out or use the arrow key many times Workaround None Slow settings for Packages Themes and Updates It usually takes several seconds until the list of packages themes is shown Or when showing in the Status Bar that there are new updates available it still takes a long time until the updates show up in the settings Workaround Install package settings https atom io packages package settings to open a package s settings directly Package discovery is hard to find in the settings People instinctively go to Settings Packages and then start to type to search for a package not realizing that they have to go to Settings Install This came up in the past https github com atom settings view issues 825 but hasn t gotten enough priority Workaround Use apm install package name It s hard to know the health of a package There are many packages that are abandoned and not maintained anymore They are either broken or have bugs that make it less usable But it s hard to know before installing a package and trying it out Workaround Go to the repo to check a package s health Command palette could get over polluted Because there are quite a few commands more when installing a lot of packages it becomes hard to use commands without spelling them out Workaround Remove packages so they don t pollute the list use a keymap or install the tool bar https atom io packages tool bar package Some functionality is hard to discover For example the GitHub package has a dock item with current and open PRs but it s hard to discover that this exists See this issue https github com atom github issues 1573 Workaround Look through Menu Packages Look through command palette Package authors could add a button to the Status Bar although the Status Bar shouldn t be mis used as a navigation Package authors need to build their own UI Atom provides some UI components like select list tooltip mini editor and there are also some CSS only components in the Styleguide https github com atom styleguide like button checkbox inputs etc But otherwise package authors need to build everything themselves It s great to have the freedom but it s also a lot of extra work and consistency lacks between all the packages Workaround Package authors could use a 3rd party UI library ',enhancement

'Unfold tree unfold everything under definition feature','When I open a file I first use the Editor Fold All command to get a high level view of the file and then locate the function I want to look into Now to actually look at the code of that function I unfold the line where the function begins by clicking the little arrow to it s left The problem is when functions contain other functions then all the sub functions are by default folded too So to see the full code of the sub function I need to manually click and unfold each of them and possibly the sub sub functions too In a language like OCaml where it s common coding practice to have many nested let in structures this makes it a huge pain to use the folding feature Suggested enhancement Instead of toggling between fold and unfold when clicking the arrow instead cycle through fold unfold and unfold entire tree Current and suggested behavior Currently after a fold all my code looks like this def foo n If I click the arrow once I get def foo n def bar def boo And to see everything I need to click and unfold bar and boo manually Clicking the arrow next to foo once more just returns it to the folded state in the first code block above Instead I suggest that clicking the foo the second time produces this instead def foo n def bar pass def boo pass Why would the enhancement be useful to most users It would save users of languages like Ocaml many clicks and they d be able to easily see the entire code of a function This feature exists in Emacs for example the default behaviour of Tab folding in org mode does exactly this Atom Version 1 7 3 OS and Version OS X 10 10 5 ',enhancement
